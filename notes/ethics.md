Normal Case:
- Article has ads
- I find them annoying
- I remove them
- I read the article
- Same behavior as what happens in my personal browser 
    - via my home network, and browswer extension protections
- Call it the at-home use case


However the source material has its own ads..
I turn it into a podcast, and the ads either dont make sense in audio format, or are inscrutible to parsers, so CAN THEY BE SWAPPED?

- Hopefully yes espeicoaly for personal use.
- But what about a cost sharing model feed model?

- What if YES (CAN BE Swapped)
    - then the source goes unpaid
    - and the syndicator gets paid - seem wrong

- What if NO (CAN BE Swapped)
    - then any source with ads detected would be prohibted from having new ads added if ads are removed.


- Did I pay for the content?
- What to do about paywalls ?
- What to do about ad swapping ?
