Would prefer a method to load an AST as follows

## Most Basic Usage

```ts
import loadFeed from "AST_THING";
const JSONFEED = loadFeed
	.fromURL("https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/.rss")
	.toJSON();
```

## Parse -> From

> from(s) -<> [use, config, to(s)]

```
.from(AST:AST)
.fromURL(s:string)
.fromJSON(jsonStr : jsonResp )
.fromRSS(jsonStr : jsonResp )
.fromATOM(jsonStr : jsonResp )
.fromCITY(jsonStr : jsonResp )

- **Geographical Targeting**: Are there any plans for geo-targeting to manage where and how content is released based on user preferences or regional legalities?



Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) is a key feature that allows you to insert, replace, or rotate ads within podcast episodes after they've been published. This can happen either in real-time when an episode is requested (on-demand) or as part of the audio processing workflow before distribution. The DAI system typically interacts with several external systems, including ad networks, analytics providers, and content distribution platforms.

### Where Dynamic Ad Insertion Would Happen:

The **Dynamic Ad Insertion (DAI)** process can be placed in two main areas within your architecture:

1. **During Audio Processing (Pre-distribution)**:
   - Ads are inserted as part of the **Audio Processing Service** before the episode is distributed. This is useful for planned, static ad placements.
   - This approach would involve predefining ad slots and filling them with ad content that is added to the episodeâ€™s audio file before uploading it to the Distribution Service.
   
2. **At the Time of Distribution (Real-Time)**:
   - Ads are dynamically inserted when a listener requests the episode from a podcast platform. This involves the **Distribution Service** interacting with an ad server that serves the appropriate ad based on user demographics, geolocation, or device type.
   - This approach allows for personalized or regionalized ads and keeps ads fresh over time (e.g., rotating sponsors).

### External Systems and Providers Connected to DAI:

Here are the key external systems and providers that might be connected to the DAI sub-system:

#### 1. **Ad Servers and Ad Networks**
   - **Google Ads (AdSense for Audio/Podcasting)**: Can provide targeted audio ads based on listener preferences and demographics.
   - **Acast**: Offers dynamic ad insertion with real-time bidding for audio ads and is commonly used by podcasters for monetization.
   - **Megaphone**: Another leading platform that offers real-time ad insertion, usually integrated with larger podcast networks.

   - **Apple Podcasts**: While Apple currently doesnâ€™t have a dynamic ad insertion feature, third-party systems like Megaphone or Adswizz can work around this by delivering ads before uploading episodes to Apple Podcasts.

### Dynamic Ad Insertion Workflow

Hereâ€™s how the **Dynamic Ad Insertion** could work, incorporating external systems:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Audio Processing Service] --> B[Define Ad Slots]
    B --> C[Upload Episode with Ad Slots]
    C --> D[Distribution Service]

    D --> E[Ad Request from Listener]
    E --> AdServer[Ad Server/Ad Network]
    AdServer --> AdContent[Serve Relevant Ad]
    AdContent --> F[Insert Ad into Episode]
    F --> G[Deliver Episode with Ads]

    D --> CDN[CDN with Ad Capabilities]
    CDN --> F
    AdServer --> Analytics[Analytics and Targeting Providers]
    Analytics --> AdServer
```

### Explanation of the Workflow:
1. **Audio Processing**: In the **Audio Processing Service**, ad slots are defined during production (e.g., 10 minutes into the episode for a mid-roll ad).
2. **Upload Episode**: The episode is uploaded with placeholders (ad slots) where ads will be dynamically inserted later.
3. **Listener Requests**: When a listener requests an episode through a platform (e.g., Spotify), the **Distribution Service** sends an ad request to an external ad server (like Acast or Megaphone).
4. **Ad Server**: The ad server delivers an ad based on listener data (demographics, location, behavior).
5. **Insert Ad**: The ad is inserted dynamically into the episode audio, either on-the-fly or via the CDN, and the final episode with the ad is delivered to the listener.
6. **Analytics Integration**: During this process, data about the listener (e.g., whether they completed the episode, the number of impressions) is sent to analytics providers like Chartable or Nielsen. This data helps improve future ad targeting.

### Benefits of Dynamic Ad Insertion:
- **Personalization**: Ads can be tailored to individual listeners based on location, interests, or demographics.
- **Freshness**: Ads can be updated over time without republishing the episode.
- **Revenue Maximization**: Real-time bidding systems can serve ads at higher prices when demand is high.
