1. What if there was a network that allowed me to directly follow a thumnbed-up list of episodes
   from a prolific and awesome contnet curator?

2. What if that same network was able to allow a monetization opportunity for the curator &
   publisher?

3. What if that same network was able to allow a monetization opportunity for a chain of curators
   inbetween the original publisher and the end user?
