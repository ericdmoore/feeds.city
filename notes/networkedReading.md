1. What if there was a network that allowed me to directly follow a thumnbed-up list of episodes from a prolific and
   awesome contnet curator?

2. What if that same network was able to allow a monetization opportunity for the curator & publisher?

3. What if that same network was able to allow a monetization opportunity for a chain of curators inbetween the original
   publisher and the end user?
