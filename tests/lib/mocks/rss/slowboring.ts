                        <p>American cities have taken it on the chin over the past two years. </p>
                        <p>The Covid-19 pandemic and associated business restrictions have disproportionately affected the distinctive amenities of urban life &#8212; independent restaurants, theaters, museums, and live events &#8212; while the resurgence of violent crime disproportionately threatens their stability. Remote work, meanwhile, poses an immediate threat to the revenue base of core municipalities, which rely on taxing both office buildings and the lunches and after-work drinks of the suburban commuters who populate them. </p><p>But there&#8217;s a difference between saying that a technological change will result in some bumps in the road that need to be navigated and saying that it will fundamentally derail large urban agglomerations. </p><p>And that got me thinking about the longer-run history of cities. </p>

Students for Fair Admission</em>s case. </p><p>In the controlling precedent from <em>Grutter v. Bollinger</em>, Justice Sandra Day O&#8217;Connor wrote that &#8220;race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time &#8230; the Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.&#8221; She was writing in 2003, 19 years ago rather than 25. But at the time, Day O&#8217;Connor was the median justice. When she retired, the median justice became the more conservative Anthony Kennedy. Then when Kennedy retired, the median justice became the more-conservative-still John Roberts. And when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, the median justice became the even-more-conservative Brett Kavanaugh. Given this substantial rightward shift, we should expect some precedents to be overturned, and since even O&#8217;Connor seemed torn on this particular question, I very much doubt that Kavanaugh is. </p><p>And the Court doesn&#8217;t need to fear backlash here. In public polling, overwhelming majorities say <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/25/most-americans-say-colleges-should-not-consider-race-or-ethnicity-in-admissions/">race should not factor into college admissions</a>. In Blue Rose Research competitive message testing (<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-permanent-ctc-expansion-with-a">previously seen on Slow Boring</a>), affirmative action performs worse than cutting police funding in partisan framing and pro/con arguments. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-589-728" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff50f5c8c-1255-45c0-95e0-5929c2471615_1100x589.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff50f5c8c-1255-45c0-95e0-5929c2471615_1100x589.png" width="728" height="589" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f50f5c8c-1255-45c0-95e0-5929c2471615_1100x589.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:589,&quot;width&quot;:1100,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:268344,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-default" alt=""><style>

But the broader world should recognize that while foot-dragging on compliance will be narrowly beneficial to the most exclusive universities&#8217; interest in preserving the status quo, there are much better ways to proceed. </p><p>The key to that, however, is to acknowledge that the top schools are bad actors, not allies, and a serious push for racial and economic justice requires redirecting material resources and social esteem away from the most selective schools and toward schools that serve worthier social purposes. </p><h4>The status quo is not in line with progressive values</h4><p>A large share of elite universities seem to be applying de facto quotas to prevent the Asian-origin share of their student body from rising in line with their share of the population.

Meanwhile, a person like me &#8212; a fairly privileged young person whose father&#8217;s family happens to come from Cuba &#8212; got a boost. I don&#8217;t know of any theory of distributive or restorative justice that says this is a reasonable formula for addressing America&#8217;s legacy of racial discrimination or present-day inequities. But it&#8217;s what&#8217;s actually happening. </p><p>I think Bill Clinton&#8217;s old <a href="http://todayinclh.com/?event=affirmative-action-mend-it-dont-end-it">&#8220;mend it, don&#8217;t end it&#8221;</a> formula made a lot of sense, but in reality, nothing has been mended in the 25 years since he said that. Now the courts are poised to end it, and unfortunately, ending it could have bad consequences too. </p><h4>&#8220;Mismatch theory&#8221; seems to be mostly wrong</h4><p>One optimistic take on the end of affirmative action is that it will actually be <em>good</em> for Black and Hispanic students. The theory is that students with below-average academic preparation struggle in their classes, become demoralized, and drop out or switch to an easier major, ending up worse off than if they&#8217;d attended a less selective institution. </p><p>There is a <em>lot</em> of literature on this back and forth. And I think mismatch theorists have found some specific cases where the hypothesis holds. The clearest case, I think, is that affirmative action leads low-tier law schools to admit <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2021/07/bar-passage-rates/">marginal Black and Latino students who have low bar exam pass rates</a>, and in many cases, those students would have been better off not incurring law school debt. </p><p>But the mismatch hypothesis does not hold up in general. </p><p><a href="https://zacharybleemer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AA_Mismatch_Paper.pdf">Zachary Bleemer&#8217;s paper looking at the impact of Proposition 209 in California</a> shows pretty clearly that, on average, the whole life trajectories of Black and Latino students took a turn for the worse as a result of attending less-selective colleges. </p><p>One key dynamic at work is a cascade effect. The University of California system runs a network of campuses of varying selectivity, all of which invest significant resources in their students. Prop 209 pushes some Black and Hispanic students out of more prestigious UC schools like Berkeley and toward campuses like Santa Cruz, so the schools with the highest average SAT scores (Berkeley and UCLA) have the smallest Black/Latino population share, whereas the less-selective UC Riverside and UC Merced campuses have more.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-1142-728" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaf9aee8-5855-42d9-bb2d-f453cd2bf29b_1220x1142.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffaf9aee8-5855-42d9-bb2d-f453cd2bf29b_1220x1142.png" width="728" height="1142" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/faf9aee8-5855-42d9-bb2d-f453cd2bf29b_1220x1142.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1142,&quot;width&quot;:1220,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:231622,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-default" alt=""><style>

And when you drop out of the system into other schools, you&#8217;re not only talking about a different cohort of peers; you&#8217;re talking about a different level of resources dedicated to students.</p><p>To flag a point that I&#8217;ll return to later, part of the harm that Bleemer is identifying is the perversity of the American system of higher education financing &#8212; we deliver the fewest resources to the students who need the most help. </p><p>And that&#8217;s a critical point because for every student pushed down by Prop 209, there&#8217;s another student lifted up. So you could have a world of zero-sum competition between Black/Latino students and white/Asian ones. But that&#8217;s actually not what Bleemer finds. Instead, he says &#8220;complementary regression discontinuity and institutional value-added analyses suggest that affirmative action&#8217;s net educational and wage benefits for [under-represented minority] applicants exceed its net costs for on-the-margin white and Asian applicants.&#8221;</p><p>That conclusion is consistent with a bunch of other findings looking at other issues in higher education. </p><h4>Top X% plans seem to work well</h4><p>When Texas ended affirmative action, it implemented the &#8220;top 10%&#8221; plan, automatically admitting high school students in the top decile of their class to the University of Texas. The idea is that due to ethnic and socioeconomic segregation, this would give a leg up to some less privileged applicants who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t get in. But since it&#8217;s a non-racial criterion, it&#8217;s allowed under the terms of Texas law. </p><p><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26821">Sandra Black, Jeffrey Denning, and Jesse Rothstein</a> looked at this and found that marginal students pulled into UT &#8220;see increases in college enrollment and graduation with some evidence of positive earnings gains 7-9 years after college.&#8221; But what about the students pushed out? Well, they &#8220;attend less selective colleges but do not see declines in overall college enrollment, graduation, or earnings.&#8221;</p><p>That is a bit of a weird finding. </p><p>But it&#8217;s strongly reminiscent of something that <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w7322">Alan Krueger found back in 1999</a> and that he and <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w17159">Stacy Dale confirmed in 2011</a>: for most students, the value of attending a selective college is low. </p><p>While it&#8217;s true that graduates of the most selective schools do better than graduates of the less-selective schools, that&#8217;s at least in part because the most-selective schools are trying to admit the kids with the best odds of doing well in life. In the median case, it turns out that the higher earnings for graduates of more-selective schools are <em>entirely</em> explained by the selection effect with no discernible treatment by the university. </p><p>But there&#8217;s an exception: &#8220;for black and Hispanic students and for students who come from less-educated families (in terms of their parents' education), the estimates of the return to college selectivity remain large, even in models that adjust for unobserved student characteristics.&#8221;</p><p>I think these lines of research all support the same conclusion &#8212; meritocratic sorting generates an inefficient outcome because educational resources are more valuable when targeted at low-SES students than when targeted at the best students. So for public universities, I think this adds up to a strong case for using the Top X% admission system. It seems more politically stable than race-based affirmative action but produces broadly similar benefits for roughly the same reason. </p><p>Two further notes on this:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w19842">Black, Jane Arnold Lincove, Jenna Cullinane, and Rachel Veron</a> find that Top X% does not erase inequities in high school quality and that graduates of the lower-quality high schools do worse in college with persistent effects. So it&#8217;s a good policy, but it&#8217;s not magic, and we do need to still care about K-12 school quality. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w16663">Julie Berry Cullen, Mark Long, and Randall Reback</a> find that Top X% does induce some people to strategically sort into low-performing school districts. This strategic sorting reduces Black/Latino representation at UT but also leads to less high school segregation. </p></li></ul><p>All told, Top X% is not a panacea for society&#8217;s problems, but it seems pretty good. Of course, the fanciest and most famous schools in America are not public state universities. And this litigation is about Harvard. </p><h4>The affirmative action U-curve</h4><p>Most Asian Americans attend college, but for all other ethnic groups (and the country as a whole), most people do not. And most people who <em>do</em> attend college attend non-selective schools. So the affirmative action question the court is currently considering is of limited relevance to the typical person. </p><p>But precisely because there are so many students attending non-selective schools, the impact of affirmative action on the distribution of students is a little bit odd. </p><p><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w20962">Peter Arcidiacono and Michael Lovenheim</a> plot the Black share of the student body at any given school against that school&#8217;s average SAT score and find a U-shaped curve. The most elite schools in America are admitting Black students who, absent affirmative action, would have attended other selective schools &#8212; just somewhat less selective. But then there&#8217;s some floor below which this doesn&#8217;t happen. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-696-728" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F742ad6be-e7a7-443b-ac87-b5a8df6b642a_964x696.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F742ad6be-e7a7-443b-ac87-b5a8df6b642a_964x696.png" width="728" height="696" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/742ad6be-e7a7-443b-ac87-b5a8df6b642a_964x696.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:696,&quot;width&quot;:964,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:98666,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-default" alt=""><style>

But if the Supreme Court makes the Ivy League stop doing it, that will push Black and Hispanic students out of the Ivies and into public state university systems. </p><p>For some schools, it will actually become easier to assemble a diverse class and seem like good progressive allies. The big issue is going to be that, as we saw with the Harvard charts up top, the most elite schools end up with even fewer Black and Latino students. In terms of contemporary sensibilities, that&#8217;s going to be a problem <em>for those schools</em> since most of their students and faculty have left-wing political commitments. </p><p>But it&#8217;s only a problem for society if our other institutions insist on only recruiting from a small set of schools. A good solution to that is to broaden the pool. </p><h4>Less credentialism would help</h4><p>Joe Biden has committed to nominating a Black woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, which as I understand it likely means Ketanji Brown-Jackson (who went to Harvard), Leondra Kruger (Harvard), or Candace Jackson-Akiwumi (Princeton). </p><p>And I think if you ask the Ivy League schools to give a high-minded explanation for why it&#8217;s good for <em>society</em> that they get to solve their internal diversity issues on the backs of less-selective schools, this is what they would point to. Because the most elite colleges in America are diverse, it is now possible for elite institutions in the grown-up world to hire a diverse group of graduates of elite colleges. You might imagine that absent Harvard and Princeton, none of these Black Ivy-educated judges would be on the bench at all. </p><p>But is that really true?</p><p>When Jimmy Carter made Reynaldo Garza the first Mexican American appellate court judge, he picked a guy who was a graduate of Texas Southmost College. And a lot of Carter&#8217;s picks were like that. Lyndon Johnson put Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court, but Carter was the first president to seriously try to diversify the bench in racial terms, which at the time meant appointing people with non-elite educational credentials.  </p><p>The norm that judges must possess ultra-elite educational credentials is actually quite new. The <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> Supreme Court had only one Ivy Leaguer, four graduates of public colleges, and one guy who didn&#8217;t go to college. And I think they did fine. </p><p>In contrast, relying on identity considerations is pretty old. There used to be a &#8220;Jewish seat&#8221; on the Supreme Court, and for over 20 years it was held by Felix Frankfurter, who went to City College of New York. I think it is a lot easier to give a coherent account of why descriptive representation matters in public office and coalition management than to give a coherent account of why Supreme Court justices need to have high SAT scores. </p><p>Absent affirmative action, we may need to confront more squarely the tension between representational demands and credentialism. In a lot of areas, the solution is to let go of credentialism. </p><h4>Give money to the students in need</h4><p>A lot of attention is paid to &#8220;college costs,&#8221; as in the price students pay to attend. </p><p>But higher education financing is very convoluted, so what it costs to attend a school can be quite different from what a school spends educating its students. It turns out that the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/interactives/key-findings-from-the-hidden-supply-of-high-achieving-low-income-students/">most-selective schools spend the most on instruction</a> (that&#8217;s &#8220;comprehensive cost&#8221;) but also generally charge lower tuition to low-income students. These schools are rich and don&#8217;t admit many low-income students, so they can spend lavishly on both general instruction and on financial aid to the small number of talented students from low-income families they do admit. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-758-728" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41d7626-1631-4352-897c-fdbffeb2df2e_1472x766.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb41d7626-1631-4352-897c-fdbffeb2df2e_1472x766.png" width="728" height="758" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b41d7626-1631-4352-897c-fdbffeb2df2e_1472x766.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:758,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:221091,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-default" alt=""><style>

But at least at the current margin for American higher education, we would get better returns by giving money to help teach the weaker students.

This seems like a good opportunity to address not only the specific controversy around those urging the United States to take a &#8220;back to normal&#8221; approach to the pandemic but also the larger &#8212; and longer-running &#8212; tensions between public health Twitter and quantitatively minded generalist political pundits. </p><p>Unsurprisingly, my sympathies lie with Leonhardt. But beyond a specific point about Covid-19, I think this dispute illustrates the important social role of smart generalists who deploy an analytic toolkit across issue domains. </p><p>It&#8217;s important to know things. But particularly as <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/education-polarization">growing education polarization</a> renders every community of subject-matter experts left-leaning, it&#8217;s important that progressive politics not become a logroll of deference to subject-matter experts. Because while subject-matter experts often know a lot and it&#8217;s important to understand what they are saying, they are also not always great at seeing across the whole field. Management of an endemic virus is necessarily an interdisciplinary problem. The ideal solution, obviously, would be to wave a magic wand and have the pandemic go away, and at one point I think there was hope that mRNA vaccines could be that magic wand. But though they are very good, they turned out to not be good enough to achieve that. I <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/omicron-prevention">strongly</a> and <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/we-need-to-try-harder-to-prevent">vocally</a> support much larger investments in our anti-pandemic technical capabilities. But we also need to make policy for the here and now. </p><p>And given that a world in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulates is clearly worse than a world in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus never came into existence, we are inherently dealing with tradeoffs. </p><p>Vaccines have costs (some public money, noticeable but manageable common side effects, a very small risk of more serious side effects) that are dwarfed by the benefits (reduced odds of infection and transmission, enormously reduced odds of severe outcomes). But some other measures &#8212; <em>including informal messaging that responsible and conscientious people should live their lives on war-footing</em> &#8212; no longer pass cost-benefit muster. </p><h4>Things were different in 2020</h4><p>When I say that, some conservatives who&#8217;ve been beating this drum since the spring of 2020 respond, &#8220;at last, he sees the light!&#8221; The meaner ones say, &#8220;why did it take this asshole so long?&#8221; </p><p>But the situation changed dramatically once vaccines became widely available in the spring of 2021. A lot of people on both sides fail to think this through, but the key concept here is inter-temporal substitution. When the <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">Great Barrington Declaration</a> urging a return to normal behavior came out, we were just months away from vaccines being widely available, and that fact was quite foreseeable. The cost of delaying some things by several months would have been pretty low, and a lot of people died as a result of Thanksgiving and Christmas travel in 2020. In-person schooling was such a tough nut because that&#8217;s really not something you can delay. But all the rest of it could have, and should have, been delayed at a low cost. </p><p>Today, though, the situation has flipped for two reasons. </p><ul><li><p>Vaccination lowers the risk of doing stuff.</p></li><li><p>Vaccination reduces the benefit of delaying stuff into the future. </p></li></ul><p>And it&#8217;s on the second point where I think a lot of public health analysts have lost the plot. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do X for some defined period of time after which X will become dramatically safer&#8221; is a very different piece of advice than &#8220;don&#8217;t do X indefinitely.&#8221; </p><p>And shifting the frame from an individualized risk assessment to a stance of disinterested concern for the most vulnerable doesn&#8217;t actually change that reality. There are, after all, a lot of different ways that you could express an abstract sense of benevolence. Send some money to the <a href="https://secure.givewell.org/">GiveWell Maximum Impact Fund</a>. Seriously. Go do it. You are not living at the edge of subsistence, you have some money to spare. Curtailing your personal consumption and giving instead will help control inflation, too. Be a good person! </p><p>I don&#8217;t know whether or not that will work. But trying to get people, especially people who think of themselves as conscientious and high-minded, to give a larger share of their income to highly cost-effective charities is a plan for do-gooding that works on a permanent basis. Asking everyone to act like neurotic germaphobes, whether as a matter of formal public policy or of actual government regulations, does not. </p><h4>Life is not currently normal</h4><p>Lately I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people making the odd argument that <a href="https://theap.substack.com/p/were-all-trying-to-find-the-guy-policing">the normalizers have won and life is already back to normal</a>, I guess because restaurants are open now. </p><p>This is the mirror image of people who spent 2020 referring to a situation where restaurants were closed (or were open but only for outdoor seating) as a &#8220;lockdown.&#8221; And it makes me think that all-in-all people spend too much time thinking about restaurants. </p><p>So as a reminder, here is how life used to work:</p><ul><li><p>Sometimes if you felt sick, you would call in sick and not go to work.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes if your kid felt sick, you would keep him home from school.</p></li><li><p>Sometimes due to feeling sick, you would cancel social plans. </p></li><li><p>Sometimes you would feel fine, but <em>someone else</em> would feel sick so your social plans would be canceled, your kid would have a sub, or something you were planning to do at work wouldn&#8217;t come together due to the absence of a colleague. </p></li></ul><p>Here&#8217;s some stuff that has happened recently in my life:</p><ul><li><p>I canceled a planned trip to Chicago because the organization that was hosting me decided it wasn&#8217;t okay to hold live events because of Omicron. </p></li><li><p>A friend&#8217;s daughter, who is too young to be vaccinated, missed a week of child care because  &#8212; despite testing negative for SARS-Cov-2 &#8212; she was identified as a close contact of a sick person. </p></li><li><p>A friend of my son missed a week of school despite experiencing no symptoms because he tested positive in an asymptomatic screening program and then continued to test positive at home. </p></li></ul><p>Some of the problems that people experienced in January were the problems of disease. I know plenty of people who got breakthrough Omicron cases that made them feel somewhere between &#8220;eh, it&#8217;s like a regular cold&#8221; to &#8220;ugh, I feel pretty awful.&#8221; Some of them missed some work because they felt sick. The contractor that&#8217;s supposed to pick up garbage from my kid&#8217;s school skipped a week because some of their drivers were sick and they didn&#8217;t feel like shelling out for overtime. Many schools have struggled with staffing both classrooms and school buses. People getting sick is necessarily disruptive. </p><p>But Covid-19 mitigation measures are causing burdens <em>over and above</em> the burden of disease per se. To the extent that disruptions are caused by sickness, we would expect to see more disruptions in conservative parts of the country with low vaccination rates. Instead, we see equal if not greater disruptions in liberal parts of the country, even though the higher vaccination rate reduces the burden of disease. That&#8217;s because those jurisdictions are implementing Covid-19 mitigation measures with costs that exceed their benefits. And by making high-vaccination places relatively dysfunctional, these mitigations are sending a negative (and inaccurate) signal about the power of vaccination to let people live their lives with confidence. </p><p>Tellingly, it&#8217;s not just that more liberal jurisdictions have these measures. The rules are specifically strictest in areas of life where left-wing people have the most political clout &#8212; universities and public schools &#8212;&nbsp;rather than in places with the highest objective level of vulnerability (nursing homes). </p><h4>Production matters for everyone </h4><p>A weird subplot of Trump turning Covid into a highly polarized issue was a confusing ideological merger between left-wing anti-capitalist politics and Covid-19 hawkery. </p><p>You&#8217;ll hear a lot that a desire to have things open is just about corporate profits or that we can fight the pandemic by &#8220;paying people to stay home.&#8221;</p><div class="tweet" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1329476792571351047&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;To get the virus under control, we need to pay people to stay home.&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;AOC&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Thu Nov 19 17:29:02 +0000 2020&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:50034,&quot;like_count&quot;:495744,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null}"><a href="https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1329476792571351047" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-header"><img class="tweet-user-avatar" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/twitter_name/w_36/AOC.jpg" alt="Twitter avatar for @AOC"><span class="tweet-author-name">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez </span><span class="tweet-author">@AOC</span></div>To get the virus under control, we need to pay people to stay home.</a><a href="https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1329476792571351047" target="_blank"><div class="tweet-footer"><p class="tweet-date">November 19th 2020</p><span class="retweets"><span class="rt-count">50,034</span> Retweets</span><span class="likes"><span class="like-count">495,744</span> Likes</span></div></a></div><p>This just doesn&#8217;t totally make sense. It&#8217;s true that because we live in a mostly market economy, people mostly work at for-profit businesses and buy things they need from for-profit businesses. So when I wanted to quit Vox and launch Slow Boring, I bought a computer and a microphone and other supplies, and I bought them all from capitalist firms. But if computers were made by worker-owned co-ops or state-owned enterprises, I still would have needed to get a computer from whoever makes computers and someone would have to ship it to me. </p><p>Who controls the means of production is an important question in life, but the issue of pandemic cost-benefit analysis is about the value of the production itself. </p><p>For a while, restaurants were closed in many places but meatpacking plants and car factories were still open. That was a judgment that the risk/reward function of production was high in the latter cases but low in the former. Restaurants were generally open to takeout, though, on the view that it was still valuable to let people get meals and that cooks (unlike diners) can wear masks.  </p><p>These kind of judgments are just fundamentally inescapable. We shouldn&#8217;t sacrifice public health on the altar of the almighty dollar. But delivering goods and services to people isn&#8217;t just about money, it&#8217;s about the goods and services themselves. Without them, quality of life suffers. </p><p>This applies in the public sector, too. Everyone is sick of arguing about schools, so consider that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/business/social-security-offices-reopening.html">Social Security Administration offices are now scheduled to reopen on March 30 after two years of closure</a>. Their closure has been extremely inconvenient for elderly and disabled people who have difficulty or discomfort accessing services they need over the internet. If leftists want to understand why a lot of people are suspicious of socialist politics, they should pay attention to this example. Having a service provided by the public rather than private sector doesn&#8217;t necessarily make it better. </p><p>Now as it happens, some things can only be done by the public sector. But because the public sector isn&#8217;t directly accountable to customers in the same way, it&#8217;s only through political demand for quality operations that they can occur. And it&#8217;s those who most need services who most suffer from mitigation policies that heavily center public sector closures.    </p><h4>We need a plan for normalcy</h4><p>Joe Biden is very unpopular now, even though most of the individual ideas in Build Back Better poll well, and (more tellingly, in my view) there&#8217;s basically no grassroots mobilization against those ideas. </p><p>That, in turn, has generated a weird cottage industry of calls for him to do a &#8220;Sister Souljah moment&#8221; against someone or other, which I think is a very confused idea.</p><p>What he should do is forcefully articulate a pathway for re-normalization, and he should do some Biden coalition-building stuff and do it in conjunction with some other key actors. The president can&#8217;t order K-12 schools to change their quarantine rules. But the Secretary of Education can make it clear to the NEA and AFT that unless they enthusiastically agree to a return to normal schooling for next year, the White House is going to go nuclear on them. Then there can be a happy joint announcement with the Education Department, the CDC, and a bunch of education leaders that practices will vary district by district for this spring, but by next fall students aren&#8217;t wearing masks or doing quarantines. </p><p>Then the administration can set a date much earlier than the beginning of the fall school year and make that the day that the mask mandate for airplanes, Amtrak, and federal buildings ends. They can coordinate with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to do the same for Congress. </p><p>I know that Covid-19 hawks feel that masks are a no-big-deal low-cost intervention, especially since you can take them off when eating. They feel that anti-mask sentiment is a weird form of identity politics. But that&#8217;s exactly the point &#8212; the masks are a potent symbol of a crisis situation. <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/rochelle-wolensky">Rochelle Walensky telling the vaccinated to take their masks off back in June</a> was an important symbolic moment. But the fairly rapid back-pedal in the face of the Delta variant was also important. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with people wearing masks if they want, and the federal government should do everything possible to ensure that high-quality non-fake masks are available. But unless the plan is for the state of emergency to last forever, it needs to end sometime. That means lifting the mask rules, and it means prominent administration figures not wearing their masks. </p><p>The White House currently believes that they have taken the pro-normalcy view, and certainly they&#8217;ve gotten the hard-core Covid hawks mad at them. But I think their stance on masks is the key sign that they, in fact, have not. </p><h4>Non-policy normalcy</h4><p>Last but not least, I think it would be smart and helpful for the White House to take the pro-normalcy side in an ongoing cultural argument. </p><p>Ever since it started to be legally permitted to do stuff, there&#8217;s been a question of who holds the moral high ground &#8212; the people who are doing the stuff that&#8217;s now legal to do or the people who are abstaining. The kinds of people who are mad at David Leonhardt have propounded a worldview in which the truly virtuous are those who do remote work, Zoom with family in other cities, exercise at home on their Peloton, and maybe engage in a little light socializing with friends outdoors during the nice weather. You may be <em>allowed</em> to do other stuff, but the truly correct, conscientious mode of behavior is to abstain or minimize. </p><p>The centerpiece of a pro-normalization initiative would be for political leaders to switch back to something more like the (misguided at the time) February 2020 message of &#8220;don&#8217;t panic.&#8221; </p><p>The message should be &#8220;get your shots and live your life.&#8221; I would pull an old copy of Robert Putnam&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003DYGOO6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">&#8220;Bowling Alone&#8221;</a> off the shelf and talk about how it&#8217;s good to attend church or join a bowling league or be part of a book club or a regular poker game. Spending time with family and friends and out in the community is important. Your kid wakes up annoyingly early on a weekend morning and you take him to the local coffee shop for a muffin and you see the other bleary-eyed neighborhood parents there and have a chat. Go to a museum or to see a play or to a movie theater and support the arts. Check out a new restaurant and support small businesses. </p><p>The last time Biden went to a restaurant it turned into a gaffe about his compliance with the <a href="https://dc.eater.com/2021/10/18/22732851/biden-mask-violation-date-night-fiola-mare-dc">finicky mask rules</a>. Next time he should go to a jurisdiction that doesn&#8217;t have a mask mandate (ideally D.C. will lift its mask mandate) and just have a nice time and talk about how it&#8217;s nice to do normal stuff. Kamala Harris should go to the Burr and watch a Howard basketball game. </p><p>In my experience, the Biden administration believes that they have taken the pro-normalcy side of the argument. What they&#8217;ve actually done is made the most extreme public health people mad at them. Which is actually not the same as aggressively pushing to normalize policy and cheerleading for normal behavior. That&#8217;s what they should do. And then at the same time, they should push aggressively to fund their own biodefense proposal to develop the tools we need to prevent the next pandemic from landing us in this same mess. </p><p>This pandemic is a disaster, and conservatives discredit themselves when they try to say that it&#8217;s no big deal. But you shouldn&#8217;t respond to a disaster with mitigations that have high costs and low benefits.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sunday Thread]]></title><link>https://www.slowboring.com/p/sunday-thread-bd7</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.slowboring.com/p/sunday-thread-bd7</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Milan Singh]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jan 2022 14:00:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6efdf5ad-c3f7-4f34-af14-411ceb5f4829_4032x3024.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[

A few notes before we dive in&#8230; </p><p>We received a good number of questions related to meat and animal welfare. I&#8217;m skipping them today because I wrote on related matters for yesterday&#8217;s post, but these topics will be addressed again on Slow Boring in the near future. </p><p>Folks also had administrative questions about asking repeat questions. I don&#8217;t mind if you repeat, but if I keep passing you over there may be a reason so you might want to try something else or even just rephrase. But who knows? There is of course an element of randomness when we get so many questions (we included a repeat this time), and this whole thing is still in its experimental phase. </p><p>Now for your questions!</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4667043">Kyle</a>: I'm interested in your thoughts on citizens' assemblies &#8211; where you take a stratified random sample of the population (usually 30-50 people), give them time (4-5 days), information (experts and pre-reading), resources and authority and ask them to solve an issue by finding agreement on solutions.</strong></em></p><p>I think this is a reference to H&#233;l&#232;ne Landemore&#8217;s proposals in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0876H66RY/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0">&#8220;Open Democracy,&#8221;</a><em> </em>and I think it&#8217;s a very interesting idea. </p><p>To take a step back, I think that democracy in Lincoln&#8217;s sense of &#8220;government by the people, for the people, and of the people&#8221; is a good idea, but the current American tendency to want to hold tons and tons of elections for everything is a bit dysfunctional. I would generally like to see fewer elected officials, more reliance on a strong civil service, and more centralization of authority. And then to the extent that we think a regime of that sort would be too distant and technocratic, we should incorporate something like Landemore&#8217;s idea of direct consultation with a representative group of citizens who aim to have genuine dialogue and reach consensus rather than a group of small-time politicians staging pitched battles for show.</p><p>But I also think it could be useful on an ad hoc basis. D.C., for example, periodically does these &#8220;updates&#8221; of different aspects of land use policy that very rarely amount to all that much due to a mix of timidity and learned helplessness from the professionals and conflicting pressures from elected officials. It would be amazing to see the city commit to blowing up the whole thing. The district could convene a Citizens&#8217; Assembly of 45 members to work with the Office of Planning, the Department of Transportation, and outside experts to decide on a definitive re-write of the whole kit and kaboodle. One benefit of a framework like that would be to force people to actually decide what they think about pretty basic questions like &#8220;should the city be more affordable with drastically lower CO2 emissions or should the city empower citizens to stop things from changing?&#8221; </p><p>Because I think most residents right now very sincerely &#8212; but also quite shallowly &#8212; want to do both things. The electoral process just rewards people who are skilled at pandering to that dissonance, whereas an assembly-style process challenges them to think through the implications of their views and come to some kind of reconciliation. </p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4665361">Liam Kofi Bright</a>: Would rational representative agents choose one billion Americans from behind the veil of ignorance?</strong></em></p><p>Yes! </p><p>Or to try to say something serious about this, I think it&#8217;s interesting as an intellectual time capsule that Rawls addresses economic growth purely as a question of the national savings rate. So he has this little discussion of justice between generations that has basically no dimensions other than the tradeoff between present-day consumption and long-term accumulation of capital goods. Today, I think basically anyone considering this topic would have environmental issues in mind, as well as questions related to family policy. </p><p>But even just construed as a narrowly economic issue, it&#8217;s a big shift in how economists tend to think about this issue &#8212; for a rich, world-leading country like the United States, I think most analysts today would put a lot more weight on innovation and the diffusion of ideas than on savings and capital accumulation as the key factors. </p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4665953">Josh Morrison</a>: Which of Don Winslow's books is your favorite and why?</strong></em></p><p>I like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Force-Novel-Don-Winslow-ebook/dp/B01M1549OD">&#8220;The Force.&#8221;</a> Rip-roaring thriller, good politics, and a great standalone read. </p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4665322">Marie Kennedy:</a> A repeat from last time- why did you choose to major in philosophy, and was it a good decision? How does philosophy help you think more clearly about politics and culture?</strong></em></p><p>My high school physics teacher, Mr. Harless, was a font of wisdom, as cooking fans may know from his occasional <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/food-lab-redux-how-to-make-orange-chicken-sesame-chicken-at-home">appearances</a> in Kenji L&#243;pez-Alt <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/video-spatchcock-turkey-thanksgiving-food-lab">columns</a>. And he once told me I should look into philosophy when I got to college because I liked to ask questions about science that he thought were dumb and annoying. And if there is anything I&#8217;ve learned from the study of philosophy, it is, indeed, that practicing scientists find philosophy of science questions dumb and annoying. </p><p>Fall of my freshman year, I enrolled in Introduction to Philosophy. The professor for that class, Kwame Anthony Appiah, is not only a brilliant scholar but an unusually charismatic lecturer and popular communicator who has for years written the New York Times&#8217; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-ethicist">ethicist column</a>. If you&#8217;re interested in learning what philosophy is all about (an interest I do not necessarily recommend), you should definitely check out his intro philosophy book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Through-Introduction-Contemporary-Philosophy/dp/0195134583">&#8220;Thinking It Through.&#8221;</a> The TA for that class, <a href="https://crookedtimber.org/2021/02/03/waheed-hussain-1972-2021-in-memoriam-a-tribute-from-the-members-of-the-economic-ethics-network/">the late Waheed Hussain</a>, was also an unusually compelling teacher and he suggested to me unprompted that I should consider majoring in philosophy. Nobody else told me I should major in anything, so I took that suggestion seriously. In the spring I took a deductive logic class that&#8217;s required for philosophy majors but also fulfilled the quantitative reasoning requirement of the college core curriculum in case I ended up majoring in history or something. But I liked the logic class, so philosophy it was.</p><p>I think that philosophy was a very valuable thing for me to study, and I definitely encourage anyone who is interested in philosophical questions to pursue that interest and not be put off by the perceived lack of practical application. Philosophy departments and philosophy classes are small, and philosophy professors are <a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/verbal-vs-mathematical-aptitude-in-academics">smart people with high GRE scores</a>. You&#8217;ll learn a lot. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-433-660" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28ba0589-91c2-4b7f-80d0-63eedf36aacb_660x433.jpeg"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F28ba0589-91c2-4b7f-80d0-63eedf36aacb_660x433.jpeg" width="660" height="433" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/28ba0589-91c2-4b7f-80d0-63eedf36aacb_660x433.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:433,&quot;width&quot;:660,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:60597,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-default" alt=""><style>

It&#8217;s pretty famously a discipline in which no progress is made!</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4665987">Jordan Stein</a>: If you were elected president and had to pick one priority for your first major bill what would you pick and how would you sell it to the American people?</strong></em></p><p>I think this question embeds a misconception in terms of what presidents realistically can or should try to do. If I&#8217;m president and my party has slim majorities in Congress and I hold my first meeting with the caucus leaders and tell them I want to push a federal zoning preemption bill, they&#8217;re going to look at me like I&#8217;m insane. The president is a very prominent person and has more ability to steer the party than a backbench House member. But no one person can call all the shots and it&#8217;s foolish to try. </p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4666198">EJ</a>: You&#8217;ve said elsewhere that traditional forms of political volunteering like phone banking and canvassing don&#8217;t work and just annoy people. As someone who hates getting unsolicited calls, this makes sense to me! Do you have thoughts about what types of political volunteering would be more effective, and is there research being done on that/something akin to effective altruism, but for politics?</strong></em></p><p>This is not the emotionally validating answer that people want to hear, but I think the EA concept that is most relevant to politics is <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/earning-to-give">&#8220;earning to give.&#8221;</a> In other words, if you&#8217;re really fired-up about the midterms and want to help, don&#8217;t spend hours of your time door-knocking &#8212; go get a part-time job and give the money to candidates. There are of course people constantly doing research on optimal expenditures of campaign research (my friend Aaron Strauss who <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/electoral-politics-on-an-unfair-playing">wrote for Slow Boring once</a> does this work), but really one of the best things a normal person can do is simply give money so the money can be spent optimally. </p><p>That said, the other thing I would really urge everyone to do is to try to be more mindful about their posting. </p><p>Suppose that door-knocking <em>was</em> a highly effective way to communicate with people. Like suppose it was very cheap to organize volunteers and people didn&#8217;t mind strangers popping up at their door wanting to talk politics. Well, it would still be the case that it matters what you actually say. If you&#8217;re knocking on the doors of swing voters in the suburbs of Grand Rapids, you&#8217;d want to try to think of something that might be convincing to those people. And the same principle applies to the posts you make about politics on social media. Any time you comment on Joe Biden or Donald Trump or electoral politics, you are communicating with at least some potentially persuadable people. If you try to use language calculated to convey the appeal of progressive ideas to people with conservative values, that might work. If you use language that is immediately off-putting and alienating to moderate people, that might be counterproductive. </p><p>Now are you under an <em>obligation</em> to care about the partisan political impact of random posts you make or of which articles you choose to share and how you frame them? Not really. It&#8217;s your life, you can do what you want. But social media posts are not private communications. And if you&#8217;re talking about politics at all, you probably care about politics. And if you care, I think it&#8217;s a good idea to try a little harder to take it seriously, just as you would if you were knocking on strangers&#8217; doors. </p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4666447">Jake Wegmann</a>: What was your YIMBY red pill moment?</strong></em></p><p>Watching how hard it was to get <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/meet-one-of-the-most-unique-homes-in-washington-dc/2014/07/03/74876972-02c2-11e4-8fd0-3a663dfa68ac_story.html">this particular house</a> in my neighborhood get approved and built. </p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4666678">Rory Hester</a>: Density and housing.

In either case, there is no good reason for regulations that restrict density. </p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4665878">Michael H</a>: How do you interact with media?

Do you watch tv? Sorry if these are too intrusive, but I am curious as to how you manage to filter in so much information.</strong></em></p><p>My media consumption is really boring. I read the big famous newspapers and follow a lot of political reporters on Twitter. Politico and Axios and Punchbowl all have really good coverage of the nitty-gritty of politics. </p><p>I mostly <em>don&#8217;t</em> listen to work-related podcasts, but I do listen to a lot of podcasts while walking around the neighborhood, working out, or folding laundry. I like The Big Picture and The Rewatchables on movies, the Accidental Tech Podcast on tech, and Revolutions and Tides of History on history. In terms of newsletters, there&#8217;s a lot of good stuff happening.

People publish tons of interesting books, but I think they tend to be padded and sometimes a bit repetitive. I&#8217;m generally more of a movies person than a TV person, but I&#8217;m watching The Book of Boba Fett and season four of Ozark right now and looking forward to the return of Better Call Saul whenever that happens. </p><p>But I really do think that Twitter is a great source of information. Twitter has a bad reputation because <em>arguments </em>on Twitter tend to be tedious and uninformative. But people on there are constantly linking to interesting articles in both the popular press and academic journals, they&#8217;re talking about new books, they&#8217;re sharing charts and data. It&#8217;s genuinely a great way to learn. </p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4666081">Matt Cowgill</a>: Does Matt plan to elaborate on why he left Vox?

But I think that in the digital era, the optimal size of a media bundle is either really large or really small. So not just &#8220;the NYT plus Substacks,&#8221; but a few giant global media conglomerates and a lot of tiny niche outlets. </p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4665762">Tim Lee</a>: What do you think of the theory that the recent rise in homelessness is driven more by the rise of opioid addiction than a shortage of housing? The theory seems to be that people addicted to opioids (maybe especially fentanyl?) are especially likely to have mental health problems that prevent them from living in shelters or traditional apartments (either because they refuse to or because they behave in ways that get kicked out).</strong></em> </p><p>I&#8217;ve been trying to dig more into this, and I think it&#8217;s useful to <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness-statistics/state-of-homelessness-2021/">take a look at these numbers</a> to get a sense of what we&#8217;re talking about. Homelessness fell pretty steadily from 2007-2017 even while the opioid problem was getting worse and worse, so I don&#8217;t think the rebound since then can plausibly be attributed to drugs. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-1456-728" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04e36e75-903f-416f-85dd-2c77e982740a_1598x1598.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04e36e75-903f-416f-85dd-2c77e982740a_1598x1598.png" width="728" height="1456" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04e36e75-903f-416f-85dd-2c77e982740a_1598x1598.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1456,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:161013,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-default" alt=""><style>

And quantitatively, it looks like the reason overall homelessness is going up is because the rise in the number of unsheltered individuals is large enough to swamp a continued gentle decline in family homelessness. </p><p>So is this caused by a rise in drug abuse? I&#8217;m not sure. But the hypothesis that it is fits the broad facts and is consistent with the cross-sectional evidence that overall homelessness is mostly about housing scarcity. So I need to read more, but it&#8217;s plausible, and I think my exciting contribution to the discourse will be to say that we need to all try to be precise as to what we are talking about. </p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4665540">Dysphemistic Treadmill</a>: Tell us more about the mental life of the aphantastic.</strong></em></p><p>To me the most striking contrast is with sound. I can &#8220;play&#8221; pieces of music that I know well in my head. And critically I can do this even though I don&#8217;t know anything about music theory or the technical aspects of playing music. I can&#8217;t really describe John Williams&#8217; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78N2SP6JFaI">Superman Theme</a> at all because I don&#8217;t know enough about orchestras to say which instruments are even playing. But I can recreate the sound in my head. </p><p>Visual stuff to me is different. </p><p>I can&#8217;t make pictures appear in my head. And one concrete manifestation of that is I can&#8217;t really remember things that I don&#8217;t understand analytically. If I see a car with a Toyota logo, I know that&#8217;s a Toyota logo and I can say &#8220;it had a Toyota logo.&#8221; And if it was an unfamiliar logo that clearly looked like something specific I could say &#8220;it was a stylized H.&#8221; But if I see some abstract shape whose significance I don&#8217;t recognize, I&#8217;d struggle to tell you anything about it because I don&#8217;t really store visual memories. I can play music I don&#8217;t understand in my head, but I just remember factual information about things that I saw. </p><p>One issue that recurs from this is that if I&#8217;m supposed to meet someone who I haven&#8217;t seen in a while or don&#8217;t know that well, it will sometimes occur to me that I don&#8217;t really know what the person looks like. I&#8217;ll try to recall facts about him and be like &#8220;uh&#8230; it&#8217;s a white guy with average height whose about my age and has brown hair&#8221; and realize there are tons of guys like that around. I&#8217;ll try to picture him but I can&#8217;t. And unless he has some really obvious distinguishing characteristic &#8212; giant beard, weird scar, whatever &#8212;&nbsp;I&#8217;ll get baffled. How do I tell which middle-aged white guy is which? But then when the guy shows up, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusiform_face_area">fusiform face area in my brain</a> works and I can tell who is who with absolutely no problem. </p><p>To me, the extent to which cognitive processes are compartmentalized like that is fascinating. The face-recognizing system is distinct from the explicit-recall-of-what-faces-look-like system.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/ask-matt-anything-2/comment/4667757">Bryce Nelson</a>: We need to hear what is truly your most important and potentially controversial opinion...who is your all time Wizards/Bullets starting 5?</strong></em>  </p><p>It&#8217;s good to close out with the really important issues.

A common response was, &#8220;why would people adopt an agricultural lifestyle if that&#8217;s the case?&#8221; It&#8217;s a natural question to ask, but I think it invokes the wrong model of change over time and how ecosystems work. </p><p>After all, consider the chicken. </p><p>Domestic chickens are primarily a sub-subspecies of the wild red junglefowl with some genetic contribution from a few other closely related species like the grey junglefowl and the Sri Lankan junglefowl. As far as birds go, the wild junglefowl are doing pretty well &#8212; they&#8217;re not endangered and have a fairly large range across Southeast Asia. But the chicken is doing way better. On any given day, there are upwards of 30 billion domestic chickens running around &#8212; they are far more numerous than wild junglefowl or domestic cattle, or indeed, human beings. In Darwinian terms, the chicken is kicking ass. But the chickens themselves tend to be living in <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/poultry-farming/">overcrowded, brutal conditions</a>. Even without being overly romantic about the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22325435/animal-welfare-wild-animals-movement">welfare of wild animals</a>, it&#8217;s clear that chickens in battery cages have lower living standards than wild junglefowl.  </p><p>So how did this lifestyle &#8212; one in which chickens are so cramped together that they turn to <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/poultry-cannibalism-prevention-and-treatment">cannibalism</a>, and farmers <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/living/heres-why-beak-trimming-of-chicks-in-poultry-farms-is-a-senseless-act-of-cruelty-2969954.html">cut off part of their beaks without anesthetic</a> so they don&#8217;t bite each other &#8212; prove to be so popular? The chickens obviously don&#8217;t <em>choose</em> this lifestyle. It predominates numerically because it&#8217;s the most resource-efficient way to support a large population of chickens. The chickens themselves would prefer a more comfortable existence, but absent some external check, the logic of efficiency maximization prevails. </p><h4>The domestication of Homo sapiens</h4><p>Stephen Shennan&#8217;s 2018 book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Farmers-Europe-Evolutionary-Perspective/dp/1108435211">&#8220;The First Farmers of Europe: An Evolutionary Perspective,&#8221;</a> details the human version of this process. </p><p>The key is that a sedentary lifestyle leads to a higher birth rate. Some of this is logistical; nomad parents can only carry around so many children. And some of it has to do with energy balance. Shennan&#8217;s book includes the results of anthropological studies on the subject:</p><blockquote><p>The earliest such study was published by Binford and Chasko (1976). They collected data on the birth and death rates of an Inuit group, the Nunamiut, in Alaska, from the 1930s to the 1960s and found that the crude birth rate doubled during the 1950s, when they were changing from a mobile to a sedentary way of life, leveling out when they became fully sedentary and then decreasing after contraceptives were introduced. </p></blockquote><p>The archeological evidence shows the same thing. As ancient human communities shifted to a sedentary lifestyle, they saw higher birth rates as measured by the share of kids&#8217; bones found in graves. </p><p>But prehistoric farmers didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;then we get contraceptives&#8221; moment that caused the birth rate to level out. Instead, some members of these agricultural communities with relatively fast-growing populations went out in search of new land, spawning new colonies. Archeologists have known for a long time that domesticated crops and animals spread from Anatolia into Europe through two different routes, one coastal and one inland. But there was a longstanding debate as to whether this was primarily a case of people moving, or of ideas being copied. </p><p>Modern evidence from ancient DNA clearly resolves the argument in favor of moving. Europe was originally populated by a group called the Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHG), and a genetically distinct group of Early European Farmers (EEF) moved in separately. Since not all the land was equally suited to their agricultural practices, the newcomers settled in a kind of hopscotch pattern and coexisted with the WHG for a while but over time outbred and displaced them. Eventually, we see a comeback of WHG genetic material due to interbreeding, with <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-the-first-farmers-arrived-in-europe-inequality-evolved/">some indication that WHG-descended people were some kind of subordinate caste</a>. But the farming communities outcompeted the nomadic ones for the exact same reason that high-density chicken operations outcompete free range &#8212; it&#8217;s a more efficient use of the available land. </p><p>As Brad DeLong explains in his overview of human economic history in the <a href="https://braddelong.substack.com/p/outtake-the-human-economy-10000-to">10,000 years before the Industrial Revolution</a>: </p><blockquote><p>Some human populations did not pursue the agricultural road. Some settled into a halfway role as nomadic or transhumant herders following their flocks on land that was, for the time and given the available biotechnology, marginal for settled agriculture. Some remained hunter-gatherers for a while. But, eventually, somebody nearby had become farmers. And the population density of the farmers grew. Hunter-gatherers rarely exceed population densities of one per square mile. Farmers on land that is good for their particular version of agricultural technology can easily support many more than a thousand in the same space. The old &#8220;forty acres and a mule&#8221; for a family of six translates into a population density of roughly 100 per square mile. When those nearby who had become farmers decided that they wanted the hunter-gatherers&#8217; or the herdsmen&#8217;s land, they took it: numbers of 100-to-1 or 1000-to-1 are not easy to argue with.</p><p>The upshot is that&#8212;unless you were part of the rich, literate upper classes&#8212;per capita standards of living were not that much higher in 1870 as they had been back in -8000. Population, however, was much greater: 1.3 billion in people in 1870, compared to 2 million or so back in 8000 BC.</p></blockquote><p>The bit about the rich, literate upper classes is important though. </p><h4>It&#8217;s good to be the king</h4><p>The subjects of Louis XIV and Sargon of Akkad enjoyed, as best we can tell, similar standards of living even though Bourbon France possessed dramatically superior technology. But King Louis himself had higher living standards than the ancient Mesopotamian king. </p><p>By the same token, keeping pigs in &#8220;gestation crates&#8221; so narrow they can&#8217;t turn around is obviously not great for the pigs. But it does dramatically increase the <em>number</em> of pigs and also benefits privileged elites &#8212; which in this case is not the assembled nobility at Versailles, but all the human beings who eat meat or dairy products. </p><p>Between 8000 BCE and 1870 CE, the human population rose from 2 million to 1.3 billion, eating up all the gains of 10,000 years of technological progress along the way. Since 1870, the population has grown much faster &#8212; there are nearly 8 billion of us &#8212; but average living standards have also gone up because technological progress has accelerated even faster than population growth. The pace of technological advancement since the 19th century has been dramatically more rapid than during any prior time. But it&#8217;s also because there have been political changes, and in most places elites no longer confiscate all the surplus. Are there corrupt and extractive elites? Sure. And there are even some places (North Korea, Haiti) where extractive elites <em>do</em> more or less get all the goodies. But we also have lots of more-or-less well-governed democracies, and beyond that, we have a range of &#8220;bad guy&#8221; governments in places like China and Saudi Arabia and Russia where elites hold power in part based on delivering rising living standards to people. </p><p>For non-human animals, the news is less good. Their populations (especially chickens and pigs) are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production#global-meat-production">rising sharply</a>, but the quality of life is bleak.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-1028-728" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F123e5ad2-7d1c-49cd-aab5-cbdf1cb2fade_3400x2400.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F123e5ad2-7d1c-49cd-aab5-cbdf1cb2fade_3400x2400.png" width="728" height="1028" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/123e5ad2-7d1c-49cd-aab5-cbdf1cb2fade_3400x2400.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1028,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:639497,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" class="sizing-default" alt=""><style>

So the chickens are crushing it in evolutionary terms, vastly outnumbering the relatively small population of Homo sapiens. But we are now the extractive elites, living high on the hog (or chicken) while the livestock suffer. </p><p>And the chickens seemingly do not have the means to stage a revolution and shake things up. </p><h4>Cutting out the animals</h4><p>Over the past 10-15 years, vegans and vegetarians have gained a higher cultural profile, which I think sometimes leads people to believe that meat consumption must have fallen during that time. But at least as of 2018, this was not the case, and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Americans-are-eating-more-meat-today-than-ever-before_fig1_325857021">meat consumption was in fact slowly rising</a> here while rising very quickly in poorer but faster-growing countries. </p><p>Broadly speaking, people really like to eat meat when they can, and I think this is pretty deeply ingrained in human history. You had hunter-gatherers because hunting was too unreliable for them to be hunter-hunters, but ideally you&#8217;d have a successful hunt and eat the meat. A big part of the farming-induced decline in human welfare was the shift to very heavy reliance on cheap staple grains. And the upward march in welfare since the Industrial Revolution involves, among other things, leveraging improved crop yields to feed grain to animals and eat them. Partly because we are richer, but also because we&#8217;ve become more skilled at horrific acts of exploitation. </p><div id="youtube2-JiYVoHEV5hs" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;JiYVoHEV5hs&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JiYVoHEV5hs?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>Despair at moral suasion&#8217;s power to overcome the deep logic of animal consumption has led a lot of people to pin their hopes on the power of disruption via a new generation of plant-based meat substitutes. And as <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/1/29/21110967/gallup-poll-plant-based-meat-vegan-climate-animals">Kelsey Piper writes</a>, surveys indicate that interest in these products is somewhat broad-based and thus promising. </p><p>At Slow Boring World HQ, we now eat Beyond Burgers on burger night rather than ground beef. Their breakfast sausage is also a big hit, and the Impossible Chicken Nuggets are poised to take over around here. And I think these legislative efforts to <a href="https://www.veganfoodandliving.com/news/texas-ban-meat-plant-based-food-labels/">ban companies from calling their plant-based products &#8220;meat&#8221; or &#8220;beef&#8221; or whatever</a> are dumb on the merits, but also drive further publicity. If anything, the meat industry is promoting the idea that customers won&#8217;t be able to tell the difference. The real story here is that the pace of progress has been pretty fast in terms of improving both the underlying products and also the public&#8217;s understanding of how to cook them. </p><p>But I do think it&#8217;s worth asking the question of what problem we&#8217;re trying to solve with meat substitutes. </p><h4>We need to treat animals better</h4><p>For all the shortcomings of the Neolithic Revolution, I think most people see the huge increase in human population facilitated by the rise of agriculture to be a genuine win. </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079R35QP5/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ots=1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&amp;ascsubtag=[]vx[p]17852817[t]w[r]google.com[d]D">Jacy Reese&#8217;s book, &#8220;The End of Animal Farming,&#8221;</a> argues that we should be working to make alt-meats so cheap that we no longer raise any animals for food. But while the living conditions of most of our livestock animals are horrifying, I don&#8217;t see the total elimination of domestic animals as the solution &#8212; it would be better to see happy, free range chickens and cows roaming pastures. We&#8217;re a long way from that being the norm. But we have seen real wins in terms of countries <a href="https://aldf.org/article/czech-republic-bans-cages-for-hens/">banning the worst cages</a> and <a href="https://www.poultryworld.net/Health/Articles/2020/4/Poultry-industry-adapts-to-changes-around-beak-trimming-574949E/">banning routine debeaking</a>. </p><p>It&#8217;s hard to get this right, in part because industry resists and people like cheap meat, but also for more fundamental reasons. You can&#8217;t write a law that says &#8220;treat the animals well.&#8221; You can ban a specific widely used cruel practice, but the basic logic of efficiency-maximization remains in place, and so you&#8217;re playing whack-a-mole. </p><p>It&#8217;s genuinely important to try, though, and <a href="https://mercyforanimals.org/">there are groups</a> doing <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org/">good work</a> on this. Part of humanity being richer is that we can afford to indulge our moral sense. If a large improvement in the lives of billions of chickens resulted in the price of eggs doubling, humanity would not starve. Right now alt-meats are more expensive than meat from animals &#8212; they are essentially a luxury good for people with an ideological commitment to advancing the alt-meat industry. But with stricter animal welfare regulation, that could flip so that a burger made of pea proteins is the cheap option, and then there&#8217;s also relatively expensive humanely raised beef. For the medium-term, the goal of promoting better conditions for farm animals and the goal of promoting better alternatives to meat are completely compatible. </p><p>But I do think there&#8217;s a difference between the long-term goal of farm animal eliminationism and wanting to see a large population of well-treated animals. The latter goal makes more sense to me and does seem to require more direct engagement with the animal welfare rules relative to technological solutions to the very existence of animals. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wednesday Thread]]></title><link>https://www.slowboring.com/p/wednesday-thread-837</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.slowboring.com/p/wednesday-thread-837</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Milan Singh]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 22:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf1c5e87-23f5-44b9-ab9d-232158ed81ae_1692x868.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[

Not to fully recount the previous post, but I think this is a low-value undertaking &#8212; unless you are a weirdo living off the grid, basic Census-style information about where you live, your age, marital status, and race and gender identities is widely available to commercial actors. Private companies are already <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/06/big-data-whats-even-creepier-than-target-guessing-that-youre-pregnant.html">scrutinizing your purchase patterns to determine that you are pregnant</a> and then potentially getting in hot water for notifying relatives you haven&#8217;t actually informed. </p><p>Given that baseline reality, compromising the usefulness of Census data for the sake of minimal privacy gains seems really bad. </p><p>There have been two unfortunate developments since my previous post on this. One is we now have studies showing that some of the specific fears about the inaccurate data were justified &#8212; <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/69mtk/">rural populations and minority populations are going to be miscounted</a> and the apportionment of legislative seats is likely to be screwed up. </p><p>The other is that the Census Bureau is rolling out new pro-privacy, anti-accuracy ideas that are going to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/census-2020-technology-data-privacy-business-be938fa5db887a0ae6858dff0be217ef">make American Community Survey data worse</a>. They say that this is required by statute. I am not an attorney and their General Counsel is, so they may be correct. But they haven&#8217;t lost a lawsuit over this. And I don&#8217;t see any particular evidence that Congress is agitating for this outcome. I also think that due to a separate set of Census controversies, none of the Biden appointees at the Commerce Department or the White House are likely to want to get involved in bossing the Census around. </p><p>All of which is to say that I hope the career people at Census will reconsider their approach to the statutory issue. And even more so, I hope that members of Congress will urge the Census to reconsider and also work on legislation that could save the Census and make it useful. </p><h4>Some Census Bureau fundamentals</h4><p>As an institution, the Census Bureau is a bit of an odd duck. The Constitution rather casually requires an &#8220;actual Enumeration&#8221; of the population to be &#8220;made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years&#8221; but otherwise leaves the question of how to do this up to congress.</p><p>In principle, all the constitutional Census requires is an accurate count of how many people live in each state &#8212;&nbsp;the text simply says the enumeration should be used to apportion the number of House seats and electoral votes each state gets. But when the Census Bureau was set up, Congress had it gather more detailed geographical information. So even though the constitutional provision doesn&#8217;t require that the Census count how many people live in a given county or town, in practice, the Census has been collecting and publishing that information for a long time.</p><p>Much later, the Supreme Court ruled in the 1962 <em>Baker v. Carr</em> decision that outside of the special case of the U.S. Senate, all legislative districts need to have roughly equal populations. Whether we&#8217;re talking about a U.S. House seat, a state senate seat, or a city council district, the districts must be drawn fairly.</p><p>That&#8217;s a good idea, but it depends on the Census providing accurate small-area population counts, something that it has in fact been doing but that is not a constitutional requirement.</p><p>More broadly, over the decades (centuries, really) Congress and the Census Bureau have felt that as long as there is a government agency conducting surveys and counting stuff, it ought to put out a bunch of useful statistical information above and beyond its narrow apportionment role. Some of that has been done over the years as part of the decennial census, but a lot of it is now done as separate surveys. After all, one problem with trying to count every single person in the country is that it&#8217;s very expensive and labor-intensive. Another problem is that it basically guarantees an undercount. The Census Bureau has started using statistical sampling to produce counts that are both more accurate and &#8212; because the method is less expensive &#8212; more frequent. Republicans, however, feel that statistical sampling will disadvantage them in redistricting battles and have successfully propounded the theory that an &#8220;actual enumeration&#8221; means no sampling.</p><p>Regardless of the merits, this means that the Census Bureau does both a decennial census for redistricting purposes and also a more frequent American Community Survey that gives us lots of information based on statistical sampling.</p><h4>&#8220;Differential privacy&#8221; is messing up the Census</h4><p>The idea behind the differential privacy strategy, as I understand it, is that you can basically introduce statistical noise into the block-level results in a way that will make it impossible to reverse-engineer the demographic profile of people who live at specific addresses.</p><p>This has, I think, roughly zero real-world privacy value, but it&#8217;s what the Census has decided the law requires them to do. The problem with introducing noise is that sometimes it&#8217;s useful to look up block-level information, in which case it would be nice if that information didn&#8217;t have deliberate inaccuracies. Census&#8217; view of this is that it&#8217;s not so bad because as you aggregate up to higher-level geographies (block groups, tracts, counties), the noise cancels out.</p><p>But Christopher Kenny, Shiro Kuriwaki, Cory McCartan, Evan Rosenman, Tyler Simko, and Kosuke Imai find that you are <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abk3283">left with significant errors at the level of electoral precincts</a>. The new Census Bureau method &#8220;systematically undercounts the population in mixed-race and mixed-partisan precincts, yielding unpredictable racial and partisan biases.&#8221; If you aggregate up the precincts into counties, the errors would probably balance up as designed. But consider the following:</p><ul><li><p>Some counties are so large (Harris County in Texas has 4.7 million people) that they contain multiple House districts, so aggregation can&#8217;t save you here.</p></li><li><p>Lots of electoral districts <em>need</em> to be based on low-level geographies because we&#8217;re talking about state and local offices.</p></li><li><p>The people who actually draw legislative districts don&#8217;t respect county boundaries when they aggregate precincts together.</p></li></ul><p>Long story short, even though the text of the constitution doesn&#8217;t require the Census Bureau to produce accurate block-level information, our <em>constitutional system</em> in practice presupposes that it will exist. Eliminating that information &#8220;leads to a likely violation of the &#8216;One Person, One Vote&#8217; standard,&#8221; an outcome the authors characterize as &#8220;underscor[ing] the difficulty of balancing accuracy and respondent privacy in the Census.&#8221;</p><p>I will be less polite and say that breaking the concept of fair representation in order to (allegedly) make it harder for someone to find out your age, race, and sex by reverse-engineering Census data is really dumb. Everyone who wants to know this about you can already find out!</p><h4>Now the other surveys are gonna be wrecked, too</h4><p>The same basic principle also applies to the American Community Survey and the Current Population Survey.</p><p>Right now, the information is anonymous, but it&#8217;s also quite detailed. So in theory you could use a lot of computing power to make accurate individual-level inferences. The Census Bureau plans to <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/fact-sheets/2021/what-are-synthetic-data.html">address this in the ACS by using &#8220;synthetic data&#8221;</a> and making other changes that compromise accuracy.</p><p>One of these proposed changes would round wage data to the nearest 50 cents rather than providing the exact number. That makes it harder to de-anonymize because it eliminates a source of differentiation. But it also completely breaks some forms of analysis. During the post-pandemic recovery, for example, one thing you have to watch for is compositional effects distorting wage data. Back in spring 2020, layoffs disproportionately impacted relatively low-wage workers in the restaurant business. That pops up in naive data sources as a huge surge in average wages, then when restaurants started hiring again, average wages fell.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker">Atlanta Fed&#8217;s wage tracker</a> tries to give you a more accurate view of the situation by paying attention to continuous wage changes experienced by actual people.</p><p>But as <a href="https://twitter.com/ATLKiwi123/status/1484228074409496581">John Roberston noted on Twitter</a>, the Atlanta Fed is relying on the CPS for their data.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a> If they use rounded data, then their median wage growth metric gets totally broken.

Here&#8217;s how <a href="https://apnews.com/article/census-2020-technology-data-privacy-business-be938fa5db887a0ae6858dff0be217ef">Mike Schneider from the Associated Press</a> describes the concept:</p><blockquote><p>The synthetic data are created by taking variables in the microdata to build models recreating the interrelationships of the variables and then constructing a simulated population based on the models. Scholars would conduct their research using the simulated population &#8212; or the synthetic data &#8212; and then submit it, if they want, to the Census Bureau for double checking against the real data to make sure their analyses are correct.</p></blockquote><p>This is a fun science experiment. But if researchers are only allowed to research fake (I mean &#8220;synthetic&#8221;) data based on statistical models, they can&#8217;t discover anything new. The model will be based on analysis of the actual data, but then all subsequent analysis will really just be investigations of the properties of the model, not of the underlying reality.</p><p>But beyond that, I agree with Margo Anderson, quoted in Schneider&#8217;s piece, that there is a question of principle here &#8212; the Census Bureau has traditionally been a source of accurate information and they are now planning to dispense inaccurate information:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;The Census Bureau is saying this is in the tradition of what they have always done&#8221; in protecting privacy, said historian Margo Anderson, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. &#8220;There&#8217;s an increasingly substantial organization of critics saying this is completely different. They say, &#8216;You have never made the data intentionally inaccurate.'&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>In terms of what is and is not an appropriate role for government institutions to play in our lives, I think providing accurate statistical information about the country is very good whereas providing inaccurate statistical information is not very good. And this seems like a much bigger deal than the largely hypothetical and low-stakes privacy concerns.</p><h4>Someone needs to right this ship</h4><p>The Census Bureau has a brand new director, Robert Santos, who was just sworn in on January 5. I hope he&#8217;ll change course on this. And I wouldn&#8217;t be <em>too</em> upset if people at the Department of Commerce or the White House encouraged him to take action.</p><p>But it&#8217;s a bit complicated. The Deputy Director of the Census, Ron Jarmin, was acting director all last year and also for 18 months of the Trump administration. And we know from recent reporting that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/15/1073338121/2020-census-interference-trump">Jarmin did some pretty heroic work</a> in stopping the Trump administration from meddling with the main decennial Census. The independence and professionalism of the Census Bureau are really important to the country, and the value of that independence in general&nbsp;&#8212; and of Jarmin being a stickler in particular &#8212; was just proven.</p><p>So I think there will be a reluctance to be seen as meddling with the Census professionals, even though in this case it&#8217;s about a fundamentally non-partisan issue. And I think that reluctance is at least somewhat warranted.</p><p>The people who really ought to meddle here are members of Congress. The Bureau&#8217;s view is that these dramatic compromises to the accuracy and usefulness of Census data are <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/planning-management/process/disclosure-avoidance/2020-das-updates/2020-das-faqs.html">required by Title 13 of the U.S. Code</a>, which was passed in 1954. In other words, it&#8217;s not the case that Congress passed a new law mandating the use of these new procedures. Nor was this litigated in a way that ended with a federal judge ordering the Census Bureau to use these new procedures. Instead, the Bureau looks at generic statutory language saying that they &#8220;may furnish copies of tabulations and other statistical materials which do&nbsp;not&nbsp;disclose the information reported by, or on behalf of, any particular respondent&#8221; and says that because computers are now more powerful, they need to start obscuring the data.</p><p>You can follow the logic that led them to that conclusion. But the idea that their hands are tied by the statute is a little silly.</p><p>And if members of Congress don&#8217;t want to see the Census wrecked, it would be very constructive for them to say so &#8212; loudly and clearly, and ideally in a bipartisan manner. And if that doesn&#8217;t cause the Bureau to change course, they should write a new law that specifically directs the Bureau to keep producing its traditional products until they are actually told to stop.</p><div class="footnote" id="footnote-1"><a href="#footnote-anchor-1" class="footnote-number" contenteditable="false">1</a><div class="footnote-content"><p>Correction: I originally said this was ACS data when it&#8217;s actually from the CPS. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tuesday Thread]]></title><link>https://www.slowboring.com/p/tuesday-thread-05e</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.slowboring.com/p/tuesday-thread-05e</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Milan Singh]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 22:00:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/h_600,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9b0f487-8b38-45e9-8c37-1a0e4859d267_1976x1460.png" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[
