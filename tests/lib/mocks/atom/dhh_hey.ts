    <title>The second-hand stress of social media</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;I'd been an active combatant in the arena of social media for so long that I thought the baseline stress it produced was mainly due to the direct involvement. Over the past ten-plus years, rarely did I go a week without getting into some sort of heated argument with strangers online. But since &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-can-t-thrive-without-friction-6cb38fd3"&gt;retiring from the back-and-forth&lt;/a&gt;, it's clear that active involvement is not required for social media to produce a stress response. Passive exposure surely does too it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is most apparent when you take a prolonged break. Take a couple of weeks off scrolling through your feed, then return, and I'd be surprised if you aren't aghast at what it feels like. The tolerance you built up from years of exposure to these rivers of unhappy, resentful, angry exchanges wanes remarkably quickly, and when you throw yourself back in without that tolerance, it's a shock to the system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That shock isn't the problem, though. It's the solution. It's your body telling you just how unhealthy soaking your mind in these flows actually is. The problem is the tolerance because it allows you to cope with the constant exposure. Meanwhile all that cortisol is flowing through veins, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Zebras-Dont-Ulcers-Stress-Related-ebook/dp/B0037NX018/ref=sr_1_1"&gt;producing everything from ulcers to heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think most people already know this, but I don't think we have any idea of how bad it really is. I wouldn't be surprised if the effects of second-hand stress from social media is worse than the second-hand stress from smoking in many developed countries.Â That's a longitudinal study I'd love to see. (Blessed be those selected for the control group!)&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The infuriating ease of Rogan's popularity</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;For Rogan's own sake, and for all of our sakes, I hope we'll soon move on from picking apart every facet of his popular podcast. But before we do, just one more thing. Really ðŸ˜‚&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this whole saga, I must admit to a guilty pleasure of chuckling at all the folks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1488151193423650816"&gt;infuriated&lt;/a&gt; by the fact that Rogan commands such popularity from his off-the-cuff approach. Here's his own presentation of his style:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;These podcasts are very strange because theyâ€™re just conversations. And oftentimes I have no idea what Iâ€™m going to talk about until I sit down and talk to people. And thatâ€™s why some of my ideas are not that prepared or fleshed out because Iâ€™m literally having them in real time, but I do my best and theyâ€™re just conversations, and I think thatâ€™s also the appeal of the show. Itâ€™s one of the things that makes it interesting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes! Fucking yes! The spontaneity is indeed key to the appeal. That's what makes it feel like a conversation rather than a deposition. There's a time and a place for depositions, and there are plenty of journalists pursuing those, but that's not this show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a spontaneity that relies on intuition, flow, and open mindedness. Not studious preparation. And herein lies the crime. Because there are other people who do far more work than Rogan to prepare for their podcasts, but they don't have millions of listeners? How is that &lt;em&gt;fair&lt;/em&gt;? They Did The Work!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the confusion of the novice. Conflating effort with value. Nobody is listening to your show because of how much effort you put into it. They listen because they find it funny, interesting, illuminating, or otherwise valuable. Sometimes those things come as a product of studious effort, but other times they do not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Millions of listeners have chosen that they like these conversations. Not in spite of the off-the-cuff approach, but &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of it. They're voting with their attention in an almost perfect market of choice. There are a million, billion, trillion other hours of podcasting someone could lend their ears to, but they're lending it to Rogan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How dare they!&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Work unites what politics divide</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Is there a more powerful, communal force than making stuff together? It pulls the shared humanity right out of people when they collaborate on making something greater than what they could make themselves. It intersects all the major sources of meaning by combining human connections, pursuits of mastery, and a shared purpose. It's quite literally a creative force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When you're focused on making, you focus on what people bring to the task, not what they believe, how they pray, or which political sect they belong to. You can avoid all these gaps simply by virtue of staying clear of them. Which in turn means that more people of more varied backgrounds are able to thrive together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the wisdom of the Mark Twain's etiquette &amp;quot;never [to] discuss politics or religion in polite company&amp;quot;. Specifically the point about &amp;quot;polite company&amp;quot;. It's the politeness that oils the gears of collaboration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All this used to be so much easier, because we never had to know. People's religious observance or political affinity could easily be a matter kept separate from the realms of collaboration.Â &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today social media has spoiled that for millions. The cacophony of likes, follows, shares, and retweets betray many people's stances on the thorniest issues. It's often hard not to know someone's leanings or affinities if you connect on these nefarious networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it's worth taking the effort not to know, and if you do, to forget. To avoid these traps of division, to chew on the bliss of ignorance. That's the choice of the creative force.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>There are no all-knowing, all-seeing oracles</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Moderating content on the basis of &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; is an impossible task at all but the dullest edges of discourse. Because the vanguard of truth is always in dispute. Out there on the edge, truth is a process, and it emerges faster when opposing inquiries are pursued simultaneously. This is the bedrock of science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rarely has this principle been proven more emphatically true than over the past few years. Our truth, their truth, your truth has been sent fumbling in the dark. Trying its way through the maze of reality, finding dead ends at every turn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This doesn't mean all forms of content moderation are impossible. Forbidding direct threats of violence or doxxing is doable, for example. But mixing these prohibitions together with those against &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;disinformation&amp;quot; is a rhetorical sleight of hand, used to taint the latter as though it's just another form of the former. It's not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accepting this means giving up on the utopian notion that the platform authorities at Facebook, Twitter, Spotify can ever be all-knowing, all-seeing oracles capable of just policing of The Truth. How could they? Even our best and brightest can't call it consistently (and those asked to make the calls at these platforms are rarely our best or our brightest).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The notion of authoritarianism has been bandied about to exhaustion, but rarely does it apply more clearly than to this: A gang of private social media companies endowed with the ultimate authority to sift truth from trash. At least in the olden days, we had the cover that our priests and saints had a direct line to the almighty, and thus their divinities were justified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;History is written by the victors, and truth is throttled by whoever controls the machinery of censorship. But while history has some measure of stability, the machinery of censorship easily changes hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That used to be blatantly clear to all sides: Don't build censorship regimes that you wouldn't want your worst political enemy to control. Hence the codification of freedom of speech laws in any constitution worth its parchment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today's calls for censorship aren't generally calling for arresting the heretics by the state (although that happens too!), but for flogging them in and then banishing them from the public squares. That's scant comfort, and it's still censorship. Here's how the ACLU of yesteryear &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/what-censorship"&gt;succinctly puts it&lt;/a&gt; (somehow this is still up on their site, &lt;a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/strangio-shrier-free-speech-suppression/"&gt;calls to ban books&lt;/a&gt; not withstanding):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Censorship, the suppression of words, images, or ideas that are &amp;quot;offensive,&amp;quot; happens whenever some people succeed in imposing their personal political or moral values on others. Censorship can be carried out by the government as well as private pressure groups. Censorship by the government is unconstitutional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note the difference between &amp;quot;I think this is wrong, and you shouldn't listen to it&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I think this is wrong, AND NOBODY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HEAR IT&amp;quot;. I'm on board with the former, but repulsed by the latter. Partly because the definition of &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; is so fluid. What's &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; today might well be &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You'd think the fluidity of the truth over these past few years would have given everyone pause from demanding the intervention of platform authorities. That the more times we see &amp;quot;our side&amp;quot; get something wrong, the more hesitant we'd be to prosecute the other side for their wrongs. But depressingly, it seems like the opposite has happened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That doesn't mean we're stuck on this path of escalation. Fighting over the power to censor in service of The Truth. This struggle hasn't gripped societies equally around the world. It's not a given. We can turn around from this authoritarian dead end, and return to the wisdom of &amp;quot;speak and let be spoken&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's not a crime to be wrong. You're wrong all the time about all sorts of things. Some times you'll know right away that you were wrong, other times you won't find out &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-thrill-of-changing-your-mind-88ff9063"&gt;until much later&lt;/a&gt;. But you're still wrong. Your tribe is wrong. We're all wrong.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is normal. This is how it's always going to be. There's no amount of subservient tribute we can pay to the authorities of today to change this. They will never become all-knowing, all-seeing oracles that we can entrust with the final arbitration of the truth. Thank god.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Spotify's completely reasonable healthcare content policy</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Here's what you can't say on a podcast hosted by Spotify about Covid, per &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/28/22907069/spotify-joe-rogan-neil-young-covid-19-moderation-policies"&gt;the company's internal moderation policy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Content that promotes dangerous false or deceptive content about healthcare that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health such as:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Denying the existence of AIDS or COVID-19&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Encouraging the deliberate contracting of a serious or life threatening disease or illness&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suggesting that consuming bleach can cure various illnesses and diseases&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suggesting that wearing a mask will cause the wearer imminent, life-threatening physical harm&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Promoting or suggesting that the vaccines are designed to cause death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What an impressively clear and concise policy! Focused primarily on the concrete &amp;quot;imminent threat&amp;quot; principle. Thus making it clear whether a violation has happened or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But I get the sense that this clarity is actually a mark of failure for those who'd rather see vague terms like &amp;quot;misinformation&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;disinformation&amp;quot; form the core of such policies. Terms that have been stretched so far that all manner of reasonable speech can be included when it serves the political mood or moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It certainly appears to be a disappointment to those who had hoped they could catch Spotify applying special treatment to Rogan's show. Under the policy as written, it's clear that's not what's happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amongst those disappointed observers is The Verge. Here's how they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/28/22907069/spotify-joe-rogan-neil-young-covid-19-moderation-policies"&gt;express their frustration&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;These guidelines seemingly allow podcasters to say the vaccines cause death â€” just not that they are designed to cause death. Similarly, they allow podcasters to say wearing a mask is ineffective, just not that wearing masks will cause imminent, life-threatening harm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;First, vaccines &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; caused deaths! The Danish state &lt;a href="https://www.kommunefokus.dk/article/view/786686/sundhedsstyrelsen_traekker_astrazeneca_ud_af_vaccinationsprogrammet"&gt;pulled AstraZeneca from the official vaccine program&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2021-04-25-astrazeneca-saettes-i-forbindelse-med-endnu-et-dodsfald-i-danmark"&gt;several deaths&lt;/a&gt; occurred from rare but fatal side effects. The family of the victims were &lt;a href="https://pebl.dk/da/nyheder/nyhedsarkiv/efterladte-faar-erstatning-for-doedsfald-efter-astrazeneca-vaccine"&gt;awarded compensation from the state&lt;/a&gt; as a result of these deaths. In Norway, &lt;a href="https://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/norge/2021/12/28/195813101/etterlatte-etter-astrazeneca-dodsfall-opprort-over-manglende-beklagelse"&gt;four deaths were linked to the same vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, and the Norwegian state also removed AstraZeneca from the official vaccine program as a result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second, wearing some masks has also been shown to be ineffective in a variety of settings (&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/kids-masks-schools-weak-science/621133/"&gt;like with kids and schools&lt;/a&gt;). Thus the new push for N95s. And let's not forget that at the start of the pandemic, it was &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/29/health/face-masks-coronavirus-surgeon-general-trnd/index.html"&gt;official US policy&lt;/a&gt; that masks didn't work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should podcasters really be banned from discussing either of these phenomenon? It didn't turn out well when the lab leak theory was banned from social media, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/27/facebook-lifts-ban-on-posts-claiming-covid-19-was-man-made"&gt;only to be allowed once&lt;/a&gt; it became clear that the &amp;quot;conspiracy theory&amp;quot; label was applied prematurely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was in Denmark when the AstraZeneca vaccine was pulled from the official program as a result of the deaths. It was naturally a topic of intense national debate: Yes, the risk of death was low, but pushing on by downplaying these deaths might well have harmed the overall trust in vaccines even more. Arguments went back and forth for weeks in radio, tv, and online.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Would Danes really have been better off if the discussion of rare but real vaccine deaths were banned from the media? That seems very hard to believe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kudos to the Swedish leadership at Spotify for reaching the same conclusion. Tack sÃ¥ mycke!&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Spotify must be afraid of canceling Rogan, right? Right?!</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;What's stood out most to me about the latest Rogan round over &lt;a href="https://neilyoungarchives.com/news/1/article?id=Spotify-In-The-Name-Of-Truth"&gt;Neil Young's ultimatum&lt;/a&gt; is the iron-clad assumption that Spotify surely must â€“ MUST! â€“ agree with the underlying premise. That Rogan is a menace to society because he &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/everything-popular-is-problematic-eb039e2b"&gt;host guests with divergent views&lt;/a&gt; on covid, and because he shares his unsanctioned opinion on the matter. Therefore, the only reason they're not yanking him is fear. Fear of losing subscribers, money, marketshare, whatever. It can't &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; be due to a genuine disagreement with the menace-to-society charge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonathan Haidt talks about this in &lt;a href="https://righteousmind.com"&gt;The Righteous Mind&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morality binds and blinds. It binds us into ideological teams that fight each other as though the fate of the world depended on our side winning each battle. It blinds us to the fact that each team is composed of good people who have something important to say.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has always been the case. What's new, or what has intensified due to &lt;a href="https://graymirror.substack.com/p/big-tech-has-no-power-at-all"&gt;novel power leaks&lt;/a&gt;, is that these fights have focused so heavily on the guerrilla warfare of suppressing speech. What we can't beat with compelling counter speech, we will threaten, extort, or slander our way to exorcising!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; in this sense is virtually always a small, loud minority with a completely inflated sense of purpose and power. (I should know. I've been in such a minority on plenty of causes over the years ðŸ˜‚).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This inflation is directly proportional to the righteous, moral fever that is whipped up. OH NO! What if some innocent simpleton out there listens to Rogan describe his own covid recovery, and then they get omicron, and then they DIE. What about that, hu? HU?!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Won't somebody please think of the [&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RybNI0KB1bg"&gt;The Simpsons Did It First&lt;/a&gt;]!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's so interesting about this particular fight is how obvious the prospect of it being lost were from the outset. Like the last attempt to cancel Chapelle at Netflix. If you're going to take on the number one music or video streaming service together with the number one podcaster or comedian, you damn well better come packing more heat than I Don't Like What They're Saying!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not just because that would make for a more compelling argument in the individual cases, but also because every loss you take in the forum of public opinion sets you up worse for the next attempt. The guaranteed failure to cancel Chapelle or Rogan over these inane speech prohibitions will weaken every future attempt to cancel less resilient figures. This is just basic Sun Tzu strategy!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But this of course returns to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Woke-Racism-Religion-Betrayed-America/dp/0593423062"&gt;McWhorter's key observation&lt;/a&gt;: These cancelation attempts are not the product of political movements trying to mobilize mass coalitions on the basis of compelling shared goals. They're religious incantations meant to bless those who condemn. &amp;quot;Winning&amp;quot;, as it were, is not the primary objective. Which I guess is some kind of wicked consolation. Given how long the odds of doing so in these cases are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, the Streisand effect continues to reverb across the realm. Every swing at the king that misses only serves to highlight his glory. Ohhh, this Rogan fellow must really be on to something, if they're that desperate to get him canceled! SUBSCRIBED!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the injury to the inquisition is then twofold when all these new Streisand subscribers find a curious, broad interviewer who brings on a wide variety of interesting people to talk about their ideas. With barely an iota of the drama that was promised. Thus ensuring all these folks who showed up for the shock will convert on the awe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are we actually sure this is not a marketing masterplan concocted by Spotify themselves?? Is Neil Young on the take?? JUST ASKING!&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>We can't thrive without friction</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Social media platforms have been on relentless quest since their inception to remove all friction from all acts of engagement. The distance from emotion to reaction has been whittled away one A/B test at the time, and there's barely any left. You don't even have to portray any original sentiment today, just like or retweet that of someone else, and you'll be microdosing on that sweet rush of belonging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We know it too! Celebrate it, even! Have you seen that new thing that just went viral? SAVAGE. Yes, this level of virulent spread is savage. Because it's literally been engineered in a lab to be so. All our natural human defenses have been studied by machines learning, and are now effectively and consistently evaded. No wonder this meta virus has taken over key parts of society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you know this too. There's been a billion articles decrying this beast and they've all been turned into feed for it. Every SOCIAL MEDIA IS BAD headline digested, regurgitated, and shat out to millions of followers. A savage cycle of success indeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This recurring loop has brought me more than a little down on the internet over the past few years. Because it's so easy to equate the two. Social media is the black hole that seemingly swallows up all discourse, people, and good intentions on the internet. And how do you escape the gravity of that, exactly?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You could stay far away from the event horizon, but then you're floating alone in space. Sure, nobody there to endlessly echo and amplify the screams, but nobody there to hear yours either. We need others enough that even if they become these warped beings, pulled apart by the black hole, they're still preferable to the cold emptiness of being alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This dilemma is difficult enough that many have simply given up. Yes, it's terrible, but whatcha gonna do? I've stood on the that ledge plenty of times, then knowingly walked into the drop. At least falling is a rush until you hit the ground!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I was blessed with a properly hard hit last April. A revelation of the obvious while in the center of a storm. Like an alcoholic hitting the same bottom of the same brand of booze as a million souls before them, but needing that individual crash to translate the universal wisdom of recovery into a personal journey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And like many recovering addicts, the final act of bottoming out appears in retrospect as a gift from the gods. If only it could have been this bad sooner! But no matter, thank heavens it finally hit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus I was moved to retire from engaging with my social drug of choice, Twitter. After tens of thousands of tweets across more than a decade, I vowed to stop responding to â€“ let alone arguing with â€“ strangers in that particular thunderdome of despair. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And like all recovering addicts who now wax lyrically about the healing power of their perpetuating intervention â€“ be that Jesus, the group session, the gardening, or whatever â€“ I fight to restrain myself from breaking out in song about the gospel all the time. (Because there really is nothing more annoying than a born-again sinner serenading from the soapbox.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But now that it's been a while, I still thought I'd share what has worked for me. To prevent a relapse, I've replaced the free-for-all of the thunderdome with connections mediated by friction. The kind of friction the internet had since its inception, but that has been outrun by the virulence of the frictionless social media variants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most important of these mediated connections have been through email. Both sending it, like this, but also receiving it from the small minority of readers who &lt;em&gt;because of the friction&lt;/em&gt; took the time to write thoughtful, polite replies of both encouragement and disagreement. Which in turn has lead to thousands of fruitful exchanges. Going a long way to give me faith in the internet again. Even faith in the connection with strangers again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second most important has been open source tickets on GitHub. Collaborating with strangers toward a common goal of improving some software. Seeing how people who've never met can find common cause in their desire to make something better, despite the fact that they may disagree on all manner of core values outside of this shared space. That's been a real reminder that work can unite what politics so often divide. And again, it's restoring my faith in those connections with strangers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Common between both modes of connection is that they're virtually stripped of virulence. While an open source ticket may occasionally garner outside attention from spectators, the vast majority do not. They simply facilitate the connection between truly engaged individuals, not for the sake of engagement, but for the sake of the facilitation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But even more crucially is the friction that underpin these forms of exchange. For someone to write me a reply to something I've written on email requires original thought (you don't get to see other replies), and an intrinsic motivation based in genuine curiosity (there's no quick hit of belonging). Thus unlocking the kind of human connections we all in theory say we want: Authentic, good-faith, and considerate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This friction serves as a high-grade filter. Cleaning the feedback of the frivolous and the malevolent. Out of the thousands of people who might read something I write about antitrust, vaccines, polarization, hiring, or whatever, most will probably have some type of reaction. Maybe they're appreciative, maybe they're annoyed, maybe they're ecstatic, maybe they're outraged. But in almost all cases, I won't ever know! These are thoughts and feelings that simply stay in the head and heart of the reader, never to manifest in any form of internet engagement that I'll be privy to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The same too is true of these open source tickets. Out of the hundreds of thousands of people who might use Rails, or any of the associated projects that I work on, most will never contribute code or bug reports. They too may be thrilled or dismayed at having to work with something I created, but at least as mediated through these tickets, I'll rarely if ever know. Those reactions just stay inside the folks who have them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This dynamic reminds me of Madilyn Bailey's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMhWQeka5Lw"&gt;song composed from hate comments&lt;/a&gt; she's gotten on her YouTube channel. While she turned that river of thrash into art in the form of a catchy tune, it's dystopian that it should ever wash over her in the first place. Not because it's a new idea that someone doesn't like a song or an artist, but because it's new to have a straight shot at an artist's consciousness with no friction at all!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the days of yore, the gates of friction defending an artist's mind were formidable. What, you were going to write some fan club mailing address a letter to say &amp;quot;Madilyn, your voice is very, very, very bad!&amp;quot;? No, no you were not. And if you did, you'd come across as positively psychotic to anyone you told about that. But with the social medias, nobody even bats an eye when thousands of such comments flood the feedback streams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What I'm getting at here is that friction is a feature! Whittling it all away such that every little impulse of every little person is connected to an outlet of expression is perhaps the worst crime committed by the modern internet, as dominated by social media as it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've flirted with this idea of increasing friction on social media several times over the years. Well before I was blessed with the confidence from a crisis to follow through on its conclusions. And the response (on said social medias!) I'd mostly get would be: BUT THIS IS THE POINT! THIS IS WHY I LIKE SOCIAL MEDIA! THE POWER TO INVADE SOMEONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE KILLER APP. Okay, usually it wouldn't be quite as explicit as that last line, but that would be the summation. Democratizing the power to force your way into someone's head is intoxicating. No wonder some of those lacking in appeal to voluntarily attract the interest of others find that compelling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we really are all better off when creating a connection to another human being is gated by a modicum of friction. This is true on both sides of that connection. Giving voice to every fleeting emotion or thought is a pathology. Listening to all these voices sure to eventually develop into one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now I don't have high hopes that these existing choices for mediating connections with friction are likely to see a big resurgence. Although to a limited extend they kinda have, in the form of email newsletters and podcasting. But a broad epiphany stand little chance against social media in a trial by combat. I do, though, have the hope that new mediated forms can arise from the wisdom of friction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like Tinder did. The magic of Tinder is exactly the friction it introduced between who'd be able to write whom. Unless a two-way connection is made, there'll be no initiation. That was a profound discovery, or at least popularization, within this friction paradigm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've copied this insight with &lt;a href="https://www.hey.com/features/the-screener/"&gt;HEY's Screener&lt;/a&gt; and brought it to email. It's probably the single most important feature of the entire product. The one that brings the most mental tranquility to the most people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What would a social media design that embraced friction look like? Is it even possible? Could it ever compete against the virality of the existing frictionless alternatives? Those seem like exciting, novel questions for the internet to answer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't think it's going to get better before we get some of those answers either. It seems like we're in a spiral at the moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also seems clear to me that the answer is not content moderation or &amp;quot;fact checking&amp;quot;. Those approaches have been tried, tested, and &lt;a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/the-folly-of-pandemic-censorship"&gt;flunked the challenge&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the current prosecutions resulting from these dead-end ideas are only accelerating the breakdown and capture of society. Its most fervent advocates those we should fear the most.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But while we wait for these new answers, it's going to be a hard sell to convince others to exit the circle. I had plenty of doubts, plenty of fears, and they were left lingering for years. It wasn't until that spring storm shook the foundation that I was compelled into action.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's not a scalable recipe for redemption!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I don't write to convince you of anything, really. I at most write to comfort you that if you too have unresolved doubts about how we're mediating human connections, you're not alone. We don't even have to agree on a solution to share the diagnosis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Friction is freedom.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>A pandemic dispatch from Denmark</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;Next week, virtually all pandemic restrictions &lt;a href="https://politiken.dk/forbrugogliv/sundhedogmotion/art8587488/Restriktioner-skal-vÃ¦re-vÃ¦k-pÃ¥-tirsdag"&gt;will be gone&lt;/a&gt; from Danish society. No mask mandates, no vaccine passports, no distancing, no limitations on bars, restaurants, or night clubs. This follows a determination by the government's pandemic council that the virus is no longer threat to the functioning of society, and thus no longer warrants broad, societal restrictions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's striking about this decision is that it's been taken against a backdrop of &lt;a href="https://politiken.dk/forbrugogliv/sundhedogmotion/art7722019/Her-er-de-nyeste-tal-for-coronavirus-i-Danmark"&gt;all-time record infection rates&lt;/a&gt;. In Copenhagen, the incident rate per 100,000 was 4,735 over the past seven days! The national positivity rate on the almost quarter of a million PCR tests performed every day is now 23%! The number of hospitalizations with covid is hovering at pandemic highs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the number of patients in the ICU &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of Covid has been plummeting. An ever-growing share of those in the hospitals with Covid are not there because of Covid. And the infection rate between the vaccinated and unvaccinated is &lt;a href="https://politiken.dk/forbrugogliv/sundhedogmotion/art7722019/Her-er-de-nyeste-tal-for-coronavirus-i-Danmark"&gt;essentially the same&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danes have taken well to the vaccine. 80% are fully vaccinated. About &lt;a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/"&gt;the same rate&lt;/a&gt; as you'd find in Rhode Island (78%) or Vermont (79%) or Maine (77%), and a bit more than you'd find in state like New York (73%).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's mostly adults and older kids, though. A majority of Danish parents have &lt;a href="https://www.sst.dk/da/corona/Covid-19-og-ny-coronavirus/Coronatal"&gt;still chosen&lt;/a&gt;, against the recommendation of the health authorities, not to vaccinate kids between 5 and 11. Just a third of kids in that group have been fully vaccinated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Danish society chose mostly to keep schools open during the majority of the pandemic, too. Particularly for grades five and below. A few months of virtual schooling was all these young kids had to suffer through. They also never had to wear masks in school or try to parse their lessons through a mask on a teacher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This all represents a very different path from how the pandemic has been handled in America. And I can't tell you how grateful I am for having been on the Danish side of the pond with three kids to live through much of it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To live in a society that &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-is-denmark-able-to-have-these-vaccine-debates-b5e4301d"&gt;allows a debate broad enough&lt;/a&gt; to factor in the mental well-being of kids, their in-class/no-mask learning opportunities, and even dissent against official recommendations on vaccinations for young kids. Without any of that turning into a tribal fight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A society that has largely rejected safetyism, and accepted that an open society will mean deaths and long Covid and other regrettable consequences. That we can't live in lockdown forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The institutional courage to back down from mandates and restrictions that made sense when we thought vaccines protected against spread, and to change the approach after the data now show it barely does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The patience and restraint to give those who were offered a vaccine but declined a dignified way to continue to live, work, and interact in society. Without â€“ beyond a few missteps â€“ the endless, pointless, counterproductive shaming and ostracism we see in the US (and, sadly, in France, Australia, and elsewhere too).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No wonder plenty of Americans are now &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bQ2rctogOs&amp;amp;t=64s"&gt;done with Covid&lt;/a&gt; on the terms of safetyism. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nisCn_s3Gk"&gt;That they too want what the Danes have had for quite a while&lt;/a&gt;, especially with regards to kids. A chance to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T18NpRqy7CQ"&gt;accept the risks of omicron&lt;/a&gt; and go on living life.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Just the cost of doing business [crimes]</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;The Dutch competition authorities &lt;a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/apple-fails-satisfy-requirements-set-acm"&gt;just slapped Apple with a five million euro fine&lt;/a&gt; for refusing to comply with the country's new requirements on App Store policies. These new requirements are somewhat oddly contained to just dating apps, as they came as a consequence of a specific complaint from a specific provider, but even with that seriously restrictive caveat, Apple has chosen to blow them off. Because this is just the cost of doing business [crimes]!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The five million euro fine is the first of potentially ten such weekly fines, which will come due if Apple continues to violate the new requirements (like allowing Dutch dating apps the right to link out of app for payment). But as Daring Fireball &lt;a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/01/24/netherlands-acm-fines"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, â‚¬50 million is &amp;quot;spare-change-under-the-sofa&amp;quot; money for Apple, a company that literally makes a billion dollars per day in revenue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the problem with fines. They put a price on criminal behavior, and if the gains from committing those crimes exceed the cost of the fines, there's a base hyper-rational calculus that says the company should continue to break the law.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't necessarily disagree with the basic incentives here. Fines should be sufficient to deter violations (and these surely are not). But I also have some sympathy with the Dutch authorities. The normal rules of commerce, competition, and regulation just don't apply when you're dealing with a trillion-dollar global behemoth like Apple. For whom a â‚¬50 million fine is chump change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What'll be curious to see now is whether Apple will embrace this calculus, and the odious cape of contempt that comes with it. Because while that might make sense in the short term, there's just no way this is the last stop. If Apple willfully decides to flip off the Dutch and their national sovereignty, I think we might just see the leviathan that is the European Union awaken.&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The Mac proves Apple can safely open the iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">&lt;div class="trix-content"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;The Mac is such an inconvenient platform for Apple. It prevents the company from making any credible claim of an impending security catastrophe, if lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/senator-klobuchars-major-tech-reform-bill-advances-out-of-committee-185350924.html"&gt;force&lt;/a&gt; the iPhone to allow installation of apps without the App Store. With the Mac, we have almost forty years of proof that computers don't need an App Store to be safe. Made by the same company that now tries to &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/apple-turns-the-legislative-contempt-up-to-11-7c65eeec"&gt;pretend to legislators&lt;/a&gt; that this isn't possible!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Worse still, Apple continues to brag about this solid security record for the Mac &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/security/"&gt;when they try to sell you a new computer&lt;/a&gt; while their lobbyists &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/apple-says-antitrust-bills-increase-risk-of-iphone-security-breaches.html"&gt;argue the opposite on Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Here's how the company presents the Mac as a fortress when it comes to apps installed without the Mac App Store:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gatekeeper on your Mac ensures that all apps from the internet have already been checked by Apple for known malicious code â€” before you run them the first time. If thereâ€™s ever a problem with an app, Apple can quickly stop new installations and even block the app from launching again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a strong argument because it's been backed up by the experience of regular Mac users for decades. This is not a platform overrun by malware, scams, and villainy. It's a thriving, modern computing platform that relies on &lt;em&gt;technical security measures&lt;/em&gt; to counter the threats to computing rather than &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-app-store-is-broken-because-it-wasn-t-designed-to-work-aa479eb5"&gt;hurried human review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Furthermore, it's proof that choice works! Choice for users, choice for developers. If users believe they're better off only installing software directly from the Mac App Store, they're free to do so. If developers think they're better off distributing their software exclusively via the Mac App Store, they can do so too. But if either of them chose not to, that's their prerogative, and things have been working out just fine!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've indeed chosen not to distribute our Mac apps for Basecamp and HEY via the Mac App Store. We distribute &lt;a href="https://basecamp.com/via"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hey.com/apps/"&gt;apps&lt;/a&gt; directly via our websites. And our users are choosing in droves to download these apps. Just like users do with the fine products made by small independent shops like &lt;a href="https://panic.com"&gt;Panic&lt;/a&gt; or huge makers like Adobe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple of course knows this is true. That the Mac, with its free choice for developers and users, is a thriving computing platform. They highlight the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/mac-revenue-record-q4-2021/"&gt;ever-higher sales&lt;/a&gt; all the time!Â &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This cognitive dissonance forces them into some bizarre logical contortions as to why this proven model of choice can't work for the iPhone. Let's address some of them:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The iPhone is special because it keeps more sensitive data than a normal computer.&lt;/strong&gt; It does? Isn't Apple's whole pitch for its ecosystem that you have all your data available on all your devices? That your Mac and your iPhone share access to the same emails, same iMessages, same contacts, same calendars, same notes, same files, SAME EVERYTHING? Yes, it is. Which means that this argument is just utter bunk. Your computer is just as crucial to protect as your phone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPhone users are less sophisticated than computer users so they need more protections.&lt;/strong&gt; They are? Who are these unsophisticated rubes who'll be exploited if they're given access to a platform with the same application installation process as every other computer ever made? Kids? We already have parental controls for them. This is demeaning nonsense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The iPhone isn't actually a computer, it's a phone.&lt;/strong&gt; Apple loves to compare the iPhone with a full-fledged computer when they need to sell you on why it's such a revolution over the past. And they love to compare it to the locked-down feature phones sold by American telecoms prior to 2007 when they have to defend their extractive business practices. At least we're not as bad as those guys! Sorry, but there's no logical refugee in &amp;quot;at least we're not Verizon anno 2005!&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact is that the iPhone is already a considerably more secure device than even the Mac! Apps run in a tighter sandbox, and everything is far more locked down than traditional computers. This is where the defense against malware rests, along with the kill-switch power to nix any app that exploit novel vulnerabilities to escape detection up front.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only thing these technical defenses can't guard against is &lt;em&gt;business model threats&lt;/em&gt;. That's why Apple employs thousands of people in the App Store review department without any technical or security qualifications! Because they're not there to uncover security threats, only threats to the faucet of monopoly rents. And they're very good at that, because even when they fail to detect a scam, &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/apple-is-an-accomplice-to-fraud-b4197da7"&gt;Apple still takes a cut&lt;/a&gt;. It's win-win for Apple, lose-lose for consumers and developers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite the inherent contradictions in the argument that the iPhone would suffer a security catastrophe if it worked like the Mac, it's not hard to understand why Apple is making it. There are no other arguments to make! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nobody but the most hardened Apple sycophants would have any sympathy for an argument that their new $1,000 iPhone &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/who-owns-your-iphone-50fe821d"&gt;can't install the software of their choice&lt;/a&gt;, lest its developer surrenders to the 30% stickup. Trillion-dollar monopolists just don't garner support from a naked attempt to pick the pockets of independent developers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So this security nonsense is the only option for Apple. But oh dear would it have been an easier argument if that pesky, successful, secure Mac wasn't there to contradict all the claims and show the way!&lt;/div&gt;
