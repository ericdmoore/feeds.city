			"content_html": "\n<p>Ben Fritz, Keach Hagey, Kirsten Grind, and Emily Glazer, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://apple.news/Aop-9TUaTTteYo3bRSAsPAA\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 2016 and 2019, Ms. Sandberg contacted the digital edition of\nthe Daily Mail, which was reporting on a story that would have\nrevealed the existence of a temporary restraining order against\nMr. Kotick that had been obtained by a former girlfriend in 2014,\naccording to people involved in the article and the campaigns to\nstop its publication.</p>\n\n<p>Working with a team that included Facebook and Activision\nemployees as well as paid outside advisers, Ms. Sandberg and Mr.\nKotick developed a strategy to persuade the Daily Mail not to\nreport on the restraining order, first when they began dating in\n2016 and again around the time they were breaking up in 2019, the\npeople said. Among other concerns, Ms. Sandberg’s legal and\npublic-relations advisers, both inside and outside Facebook,\nworried that a story would reflect negatively on her reputation as\nan advocate for women.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s a well-worn adage but never more true: it’s the cover-up that does you in. Sandberg’s efforts to bury this story are now far more damaging to her reputation than the actual story would have been. She wasn’t even involved — only Kotick was.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Facebook recently started a review of Ms. Sandberg’s actions and\nwhether she violated the company’s rules, according to people\nclose to her and to Mr. Kotick. The review started after The Wall\nStreet Journal began reporting on the incidents late last year,\nthose people said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sandberg might be in some actual trouble over this. Having Facebook staffers do dirty work for Facebook is shitty, but it’s their job. Having them do dirty work for a boyfriend at Activision is something else. I’m no corporate governance expert but I think if she had called the Daily Mail, on her own, only as herself, it’d arguably have been defensible.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The digital edition of the Daily Mail, which is called the\nMailOnline and operates separately from the print publication,\nnever published a story. Its reporting stemmed from 2014 court\nfilings it had obtained that showed that an ex-girlfriend of Mr.\nKotick’s had received a temporary restraining order against him\nafter alleging that he harassed her at her home, according to\npeople familiar with the situation and documents reviewed by the\nJournal.</p>\n\n<p>The woman had initially petitioned for a longer-lasting order, but\nthree weeks later the matter was removed from the court calendar\nat the request of both parties, and the temporary restraining\norder ended and the petition was dismissed, according to Los\nAngeles County Superior Court records. The accuser later told\npeople that the declaration she filed for the restraining order\nincluded many allegations that were either exaggerated or untrue,\naccording to some of the people with knowledge of the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the weirdest part of the story — Kotick’s ex-girlfriend effectively had <em>nevermind</em>ed the whole thing. If the story had come out in 2016 or 2019, it would have blown over as nothing more than a bad breakup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sandberg-facebook-kotick-activision-blizzard-daily-mail-11650549074\">wsj.com/articles/sandberg-facebook-kotick-activision…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

The shots do\nprovide these patients with very meaningful protection as a rule,\nJennifer Nuzzo, the director of the Pandemic Center at Brown\nUniversity School of Public Health, told me. To suggest otherwise\n“is just a complete distortion.... It’s just scaring people, and\nit’s not saving lives.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>Antibodies matter, but they matter most for <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm3425\">preventing\nillness</a>, at any level of severity. Regarding the most\ndangerous outcomes from disease, recent research from the CDC\nindicates that — shot for shot — the immunocompromised achieve\n<em>most of the same benefits as healthy people</em>. One study,\npublished in March, looked at the pandemic’s Delta wave and found\nthat three doses of an mRNA vaccine gave immunocompromised people\n<a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj-2021-069761\">87 percent protection</a> against hospitalization, compared\nwith 97 percent for others. Another CDC report, also out last\nmonth, suggested that on the very worst outcomes — the need for a\nbreathing tube, or death — mRNA vaccines were <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7112e1.htm\">74 percent\neffective</a> for immunocompromised patients (including many\nwho hadn’t gotten all their shots), and 92 percent effective for\nthe immunocompetent. A 10-to-20-percentage-point gap in safety\nfrom the most dire outcomes is consequential, especially for those\nwho are most susceptible to the disease. Still, these results\nshould reassure us that the immunocompromised are not fighting\nthis battle unarmed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Vaccines, vaccines, vaccines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/04/covid-vaccine-is-effective-immunocompromised/629596/\">theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/04/covid-vaccine-is…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

But they are sharply\nat odds with the habits and values of huge numbers of Americans.\nFortunately, they do not have the force of law.

The problem is that mask-wearing is\nannoying and socially divisive, with efforts to enforce the rule\ngenerating clashes between passengers and airline staff.</p>\n\n<p>So the judge — a Trump appointee who is surely no fan of Biden,\nPelosi or their party — may have succeeded in getting an awkward\ntopic off the agenda.

The company’s\nshares cratered more than 25% in extended hours after the report\non more than a full day’s worth of trading volume. Fellow\nstreaming stocks Roku, Spotify and Disney also tumbled in the\nafter-hours market after Netflix’s brutal update.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix is forecasting a global paid subscriber loss of 2 million\nfor the second quarter. The last time Netflix lost subscribers was\nOctober 2011. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Co-CEO Reed Hastings said the company is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/19/netflix-is-exploring-lower-priced-ad-supported-plans-after-years-of-resisting.html\">exploring lower-priced,\nad-supported tiers</a> as a means to bring in new subscribers\nafter years of resisting advertisements on the platform.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix previously told shareholders it expected to add 2.5\nmillion net subscribers during the first quarter. Analysts had\npredicted that number would be closer to 2.7 million. During the\nsame period a year ago, Netflix added 3.98 million paid users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s a big miss — expecting to add 2.5 million subscribers and instead losing some, and now expecting to <em>lose</em> millions next quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s one spitball idea for what’s wrong: too much focus on <em>quantity</em> of content and not nearly enough on <em>quality</em>. My wife and I have been slowly watching old seasons of <em>Seinfeld</em> on Netflix when we have nothing else to watch, or just want to watch one more easily-digestible show before going to bed. But it occurred to me this week that we haven’t watched <em>anything</em> else on Netflix in weeks. Just old <em>Seinfelds</em>. We’re watching lots of stuff on HBO Max and Apple TV+, and some new movies on Disney+, Hulu, and even Paramount+ — but not Netflix. This is a sample size of one family of three, but at this point, if we were forced to drop one of our streaming subscriptions, Netflix might be the first to go, based purely on what we’re actually watching. It seems weird that the only thing we’ve watched recently on Netflix is a sitcom from 25 years ago. The last Netflix original I can recall watching was (the admittedly very good) <em><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/dont-look-up-2021/\">Don’t Look Up</a></em>, and we’re looking forward to the final episodes of <em>Ozark</em>. But right now HBO Max has <em><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/film/the-batman/\">The Batman</a></em>, Disney+ has all their recent theatrical releases and <em>The Kenobi Chronicles</em> coming soon, and Apple TV+ has <em>Slow Horses</em> and <em>Severance</em>. (<em>Severance</em> is probably my favorite show or movie in years — it’s so fucking good.)</p>\n\n<p>The average quality of the average Netflix original just isn’t very good compared to their competition — not enough to justify the highest subscription prices in the industry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/19/netflix-nflx-earnings-q1-2022.html\">cnbc.com/2022/04/19/netflix-nflx-earnings-q1-2022.html</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Owners of establishments with\na FCO of 201-350 must pay $8,500; those with 351-500 must pay\n$12,350 while those with places that can serve 501-750 people must\npay $13,700.</p>\n\n<p>The rate goes even higher: If you have a bar/restaurant that can\nserve 751-1000 people, you would have to pay $19,000 for the\nSunday Ticket; $28,125 for a place with a FCO of 1,001-1500; and\n$37,500 for an establishment with a FCO of 1,501 to 2,000.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you have a mega place that can serve between 2,001 and\n5,000 people, you’ll need to fork over $78,000!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I omitted bars and restaurants from <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2022/04/apple_nfl_sunday_ticket\">my piece yesterday</a> on Apple purportedly having already secured the rights for Sunday Ticket streaming rights in 2023, but it’s worth thinking about. Even small bars and restaurants pay a <em>lot</em> more for Sunday Ticket than home users do. And my understanding is that businesses <em>have</em> to get it via satellite DirecTV service — there’s no streaming option.</p>\n\n<p>Even consumer Sunday Ticket is <a href=\"https://nflsthelp.directv.com/hc/en-us/articles/204503399-How-do-I-find-out-if-I-am-eligible-to-purchase-NFLSUNDAYTICKET-TV-\">only available via streaming for certain people</a> — students, and people who live in multi-unit buildings who can’t install a satellite dish, for example.</p>\n\n<p>I would expect all of this to change under Apple. Swann speculates that even if Apple secures the rights for streaming, that <em>businesses</em> might still be served by DirecTV. I can’t see that happening. No way does Apple pay $2 or 2.5 billion for <em>partial</em> Sunday Ticket rights. At that price, Apple should reasonably demand exclusive rights, which means Sunday Ticket will only be available via streaming, and NFL fans can climb up on their roofs and disconnect their DirecTV dishes.</p>\n\n<p>When you think about it, it seems obvious the NFL would want to move in this direction. Even if, say, Apple bid the exact same amount for Sunday Ticket as DirecTV, it seems to me the NFL would prefer to sell the rights to Apple. Streaming is the future. Satellite TV service has always been a niche, at best, and at this point is going the way of the dodo. If you’ll forgive mixing sports metaphors, <a href=\"https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2011/10/steve-jobs-used-wayne-gretzky-as-inspiration.html\">skate to where the puck is heading</a>, not where it’s been.</p>\n\n<p>The question is, how will Apple charge bars and restaurants for Sunday Ticket? And what sort of equipment will they need to set it up <em>and</em> control it?</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://tvanswerman.com/2021/10/19/nfl-sunday-ticket-how-much-do-bars-restaurants-pay/\">tvanswerman.com/2021/10/19/nfl-sunday-ticket-how-much-do…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

			"content_html": "\n<p>From an open letter signed by over 100 industry professionals:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Final Cut Pro is a wonderful application used by many YouTubers,\neducation and small business content creators worldwide. We know\nwhy it is successful. It is liberating, efficient and fun to work\nwith. But, unfortunately in professional film and TV, editors who\nuse Final Cut Pro are a tiny minority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I seldom link to open letters because I generally think they’re pointless. And I wavered on linking to this one because it isn’t particularly well-written. The above paragraph that I quoted is the nut of it: Final Cut Pro has great bones, many pros who do use it love it, but it’s hard to use in many pro workflows because so few pros do use it. This quote from the preface to the actual letter addresses it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Steven Sanders, editor in chief of the Fox TV series <em>War of\nthe Worlds</em> season 3, said, “The two main reasons why I am often not\nallowed to choose my favourite editing application, which is Final\nCut Pro are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Collaboration! Editing big productions needs collaboration.\nDifferent users have to be able to access the same library at\nthe same time. There is no way around this. Avid Media Composer\ndoes it and even DaVinci Resolve does it. Apple still targets\nthe single user. They have to change that. That will change\neverything.</p></li>\n<li><p>Many professionals do not know how Final Cut works. They are\nafraid of it, even regard is as ‘iMovie Pro.’ I hear that all\nthe time in my business. This perception really has to change.”</p></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, these Final Cut Pro-using professionals are asking Apple to do whatever it takes to make Final Cut Pro more popular in the industry. That it’s so seldom used — to name one example, it’s not on Netflix’s list of approved products for their own commissioned productions — is proof that something has gone deeply awry.</p>\n\n<p>Scott Simmons, writing at ProVideo Coalition, <a href=\"https://www.provideocoalition.com/an-open-letter-to-tim-cook-about-final-cut-pro-signed-by-editors-and-post-production-pros-around-the-world/\">has culled a bunch of insightful comments from fellow signers of the letter</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.gopetition.com/petitions/support-open-letter-to-tim-cook-about-final-cut-pro.html\">gopetition.com/petitions/support-open-letter-to-tim-cook…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Virtual-reality platform Horizon Worlds\nis considered an integral piece of Meta’s unfolding metaverse. The\ncompany said it will take up to 47.5% on each transaction, which\nincludes a “hardware platform fee” of 30% via its Meta Quest\nStore, as well as a 17.5% cut on Horizon Worlds.</p>\n\n<p>“We think it’s a pretty competitive rate in the market. We\nbelieve in the other platforms being able to have their share,”\nVivek Sharma, Meta’s vice president of Horizon, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/11/23020684/meta-horizon-worlds-test-creators-sell-virtual-items-monetization\">told The\nVerge</a>. [...]</p>\n\n<p>“Meta has repeatedly taken aim at Apple for charging developers a\n30% commission for in-app purchases in the App Store — and have\nused small businesses and creators as a scapegoat at every turn,”\nApple spokesman Fred Sainz said in an email to MarketWatch. “Now — Meta seeks to charge those same creators significantly more\nthan any other platform.

It goes to show that while they seek to use Apple’s\nplatform for free, they happily take from the creators and small\nbusinesses that use their own.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Did Zuckerberg lose a bet to Tim Cook or something?

			"content_html": "\n<p><a href=\"https://thestreamable.com/news/report-nfl-sunday-ticket-to-apple-tv-plus-may-be-done-deal\">Matt Tamanini, writing for The Streamable</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to one industry insider, Apple might have already\nsecured the most sought-after rights package in all of\nbroadcasting and is just waiting for the most opportune time to\nannounce it. In a <a href=\"https://puck.news/ruperts-age-apple-nfl-and-the-bomb-of-the-pandemic/\">Q&amp;A article for Puck News</a>, the\nentertainment news outlet’s founding partner Matthew Belloni said\nthat while his sources are telling him that Apple is in the\ndriver’s seat to secure the NFL Sunday Ticket rights beginning in\nthe fall of 2023, others are saying that the deal is already done.</p>\n\n<p>“One source told me this weekend that the deal is actually done,”\nBelloni wrote, “and is being kept quiet at Apple’s request, which\nI haven’t confirmed and don’t know for a fact; Apple isn’t\ncommenting.”</p>\n\n<p>If this is in fact true, it would line up with how Apple likes to\ndole out information. <a href=\"https://thestreamable.com/news/report-apple-considering-streaming-mlb-games\">Despite reports abounding for months</a>,\nApple CEO Tim Cook chose to hold the announcement of Major League\nBaseball coming to <a href=\"https://thestreamable.com/video-streaming/apple-tv-plus\">Apple TV+</a> for <a href=\"https://thestreamable.com/news/apple-announces-friday-night-baseball-mlb-big-inning-coming-to-apple-tv-plus\">one of their previously\nscheduled keynote presentations</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know nothing about these negotiations between Apple and the NFL, but I do think it’s true that if Apple <em>has</em> already secured these rights, they’d prefer to keep the deal under wraps until a time of their own choosing to announce them. But it doesn’t seem feasible to keep the deal under wraps until the NFL’s 2023 seasons starts next year. Even if Apple and the NFL keep their mouths shut, the media industry is gossipy as hell, and word would likely leak from other parties, like Amazon and Disney. Let alone DirecTV, which is going to have to tell their longtime subscribers eventually.</p>\n\n<p>NFL Sunday Ticket, as currently offered from DirecTV, is by anyone’s standards expensive:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The streamer’s baseball package only includes two games per week,\nwhile the NFL package would allow fans to watch all out-of-market\ngames. Currently on DIRECTV, the Sunday Ticket’s To Go plan costs\n$73.49 per month during the season or $293.96 for the season while\ntheir Max Plan — which also includes NFL RedZone and DIRECTV’s\nFantasy Zone — runs $99 per month and $395.99 for the season.</p>\n\n<p>If Apple wanted to make one of those options available to all\nsubscribers, it would undoubtedly require an increase in their\nmonthly subscription fee, or the more likely option is that they\nwould keep the monthly fee at the low $4.99 level and make Sunday\nTicket available for an add-on price. The question then becomes,\nhow much does the streamer charge for the a la carte option?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t know about the “undoubtedly” there. It seems unlikely, I agree, that Apple would pay $2 billion per year for Sunday Ticket rights and then just include those games as part of the standard TV+ subscription, for all users. I think it’s even <em>less</em> likely that Apple would raise the prices for all TV+ users, whether they’re interested in NFL football or not. (TV+ is a worldwide service, for one thing, and in some countries, “football” is a different sport.) But it doesn’t seem <em>impossible</em> to me that Apple would just include Sunday Ticket for all TV+ subscribers, without raising the price. The question is, why does Apple want to stream NFL games? To make money directly from those games, or to get as many people as possible to try TV+ and eventually subscribe?</p>\n\n<p>Some quick back-of-the-envelope math. At $5/month an Apple TV+ subscriber pays Apple $60/year. $2 billion divided by $60 comes to about 33 million — that’s how many new TV+ subscribers Apple would need to add, based on Sunday Ticket alone, to break even on the deal. (For the sake of argument, let’s just say that family plan and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-one/\">Apple One bundle subscribers</a> are paying about $5/month for TV+ content too, as part of their subscription tiers. It also seems possible that the rights for Sunday Ticket might sell for more like $2.5 billion. Half a billion dollars here, half a billion dollars there — it adds up.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nflcommunications.com/Documents/NFL%202021%20Viewership.pdf\">According to the NFL, regular season games last year averaged 17 million total viewers</a>. It’s worth noting, though, that average viewership is driven primary by <em>in</em>-market games, not out-of-market games. Most NFL fans watch one game on Sundays: their local team, via local TV. The games broadcast on your local TV channels are geo-excluded from Sunday Ticket — to watch them, you need to either watch on traditional TV or via a streaming service that includes your local TV channels. “All the Sunday afternoon games <em>except</em> for your favorite team” is not a selling point for most NFL fans.</p>\n\n<p>The top-rated national broadcast, NBC’s Sunday Night Football, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2022/01/tom-brady-nfl-sunday-night-football-viewership-rise-tv-history-nbc-1234908545/\">averaged 18.5 million viewers per week last year</a>. But Sunday Ticket doesn’t include the Thursday, Sunday, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/16/aikman-buck-mnf\">Monday night</a> national games, which the NFL sells the rights to separately. I’m just including Sunday Night Football’s viewership for context.</p>\n\n<p>So can Apple feasibly get 30+ million new TV+ subscribers just by offering access to NFL Sunday Ticket with a standard TV+ subscription? That doesn’t seem possible. But that doesn’t mean they wouldn’t do it anyway, just to drive TV+ subscriptions by <em>some</em> number of millions of additional subscribers, and by raising awareness of TV+ in general.</p>\n\n<p>If Apple does get the rights to Sunday Ticket, and they do choose to charge subscribers a premium for access to it, I think there’s a good chance that they’ll charge substantially less than DirecTV’s rates — that Apple will still try to make it more of a mass-market play for regular NFL fans, not just for superfans and gambling junkies.</p>\n\n<p>I am reminded of Fox obtaining the broadcast rights for NFL games back in 1993. A few years ago <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2018/12/13/18137938/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc\">The Ringer put together a good oral history of that deal</a>. Fox spent a then-record $1.6 billion for the rights to the NFC games that had theretofore been broadcast on CBS, and they hired away all of CBS’s broadcasting talent, including John Madden. The point wasn’t just to put the best NFL games on Fox, the point was to put Fox itself on the map, to establish Fox as a peer to the big three traditional networks.</p>\n\n<p>To me, that should be the point of Apple securing the rights to Sunday Ticket. Not just to get NFL games on Apple TV+, but to further cement TV+ as a top-shelf streaming service.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

			"content_html": "\n<p>Rich Siegel, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/comp.sys.mac.announce/c/gvPGyuX3UCs\">30 years ago this week</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is the first public release of BBEdit, which is a free text\neditor that has been under development and extensive in-house\ntesting for the past two years.</p>\n\n<p>BBEdit is 32-bit clean, compatible with any Macintosh running\nsystem version 6.0 or later, and when running under System 7.0,\ntakes specific advantage of new features to enhance performance\nand appearance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“32-bit clean” was a bugaboo at the time for older Mac apps (the platform was only 8 years old, so “older” wasn’t very old) to run on System 7.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>BBEdit is also very economical with respect to disk and memory\nusage; it will run in a partition as small as 256K. The size of\nany file is only limited by the amount of memory available in\nBBEdit’s partition; there is no 32K upper bound.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Text editors that used the standard system text editing APIs in that era were limited to opening files no larger than 32 kilobytes. That felt constraining even back in 1992. BBEdit could open files as large as the amount of available RAM. Times and technology have certainly changed, as has BBEdit, but BBEdit today (version 14.1, <a href=\"https://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/notes-14.1.html\">released a month ago</a>) is remarkably similar in spirit to BBEdit then.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>BBEdit offers fast and flexible multi-file search and replace\ncapabilities; under System 7, it can also use On Location 2.0 as a\nsearching engine. Grep pattern-matching is available for single-\nor multi-file searches.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I started using BBEdit in the fall of 1992. I think the version number was 2.1. (Anyone who claims to have used BBEdit 1.x is either misremembering or was a colleague or friend of Rich Siegel’s in 1991.) BBEdit’s multi-file search and replace remains the best I’ve ever seen. In 1992, though, it was a breakthrough. </p>\n\n<p>And I remember thinking, “Grep search, what’s that about?”</p>\n\n<p>Eight years later I was working at Bare Bones Software. My lasting contribution: tweaking the user manual’s Grep chapter when BBEdit 6.something adopted the <a href=\"https://www.pcre.org/\">PCRE</a> regular expression engine; theretofore it had been using a heavily modified version of <a href=\"https://garyhouston.github.io/regex/\">Henry Spencer’s original library</a>.</p>\n\n<p>18 years ago I created Markdown in BBEdit, with the intention of using it from BBEdit. That’s worked out pretty well — just about every long piece I’ve written for Daring Fireball was written in BBEdit (including this one, natch). At that time, I considered BBEdit mature and well-established.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Discussions marking this week’s anniversary <a href=\"https://www.metafilter.com/195001/It-still-doesnt-suck-BBEdit-turns-30\">on MetaFilter</a> and <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31008290\">Hacker News</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2022/04/mac-text-editor-bbedit-celebrates-20th-anniversary/\">Jason Snell, at Six Colors</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I use BBEdit every day. I write most of my stories in BBEdit.\nSometimes <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/tag/bbedit/\">I write <em>about</em> BBEdit in\nBBEdit</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2022/04/14/bbedit-turns-30/\">Michael Tsai</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’ve been using it since a year or two later, and I doubt there’s\nan app I’ve spent more time in. And let’s not forget the excellent\ndocumentation and customer support that go along with the app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/peternlewis/status/1514069879191908358\">Peter Lewis</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Congratulations on 30 years of BBEdit! I’ve definitely been using\nit for at least 29 years and I can’t imagine my Mac without it. It\nis the absolutely gold standard for release notes, quality and\nreliability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And lastly, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisSmith_RSB/status/1513891571401478144\">Christian Smith</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I can think of no other piece of software that has stayed so true\nto its original design principles as BBEdit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I can’t put it better than that.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

Pricing\nfor international members will remain unchanged, Peloton said. The\ncost of a digital-only membership, for people who don’t own any of\nPeloton’s equipment, will still be $12.99 a month.</p>\n\n<p>Peloton explained the decision in <a href=\"https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/update-on-pricing\">a company blog post</a> shared\nwith CNBC. “There’s a cost to creating exceptional content and an\nengaging platform,” the company said. The price increases will\nallow Peloton to continue to deliver to users, it added. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The price of its Bike will drop to $1,445 from $1,745. The cost\nincludes a $250 shipping and set-up fee. The Bike+ will drop to\n$1,995 from $2,495. The Tread machine will sell for $2,695,\ndown from $2,845. The Tread cost includes a $350 shipping and\nset-up fee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hey, prices go up. Inflation is running high. OK. But raising the prices <em>only</em> for people who already paid for Peloton’s premium-priced hardware and not for people on the digital-only plan doesn’t pass the sniff test that this is about the cost of content creation. If it were really about content creation costs, they’d raise subscription prices for everyone, or, only for the people who haven’t also purchased Peloton devices that cost $2000 or more.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not like $39/month was cheap. It seems transparently obvious that they’re just soaking their best and most loyal customers — the ones whose hardware purchases have tied them to Peloton. (Unsubscribe and your bike or treadmill still works, but the display becomes useless. <strong>Update:</strong> Well, not totally useless. The display will still show you basic dashboard stats, like time, resistance, and distance — you just can’t use the display to show classes or anything entertainment-related.)</p>\n\n<p>So the message to prospective new buyers is “<em>We’ve lowered prices on our hardware; buy one today and we’ll squeeze you for more later.</em>” Good messaging.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/14/peloton-raises-subscription-fees-cuts-prices-for-bikes-treads.html\">cnbc.com/2022/04/14/peloton-raises-subscription-fees-cuts…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

			"content_html": "\n<p>A few updates to <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/the_apple_studio_display\">my review of the Apple Studio</a>, after using it just about every day for the last month.</p>\n\n<h2>What I’m Buying</h2>\n\n<p>I’m ordering a Studio Display with the works: the nano-texture display and the height-adjustable stand. I saw the nano-texture display in person at an Apple Store, and it seems just what I need for a window-filled office. Reflections just disappear. It’s like magic.</p>\n\n<p>But I can see why — $300 price difference aside — the nano-texture finish is not to everyone’s liking. Side-by-side with a regular glossy-finish Studio Display, the nano-texture display looks ... a bit dull? It’s just as bright, and I don’t think it looks less sharp, but the glossy glass makes everything look more vibrant on screen. Personally, I prefer the less-vibrant-but-still-just-as-bright look, and if I could pay $300 extra to get a similar nano-texture/matte finish on a MacBook Pro display, I’d spring for that, too.</p>\n\n<h2>Restarting the Apple Studio Display</h2>\n\n<p>Yesterday I noticed that the audio output from my Studio Display review unit was garbled. All audio, from all sources, was stuttered and jittery. Not just a little bit off, but unlistenable. Audio from my MacBook Pro’s built-in speakers, or from headphones, was fine. Detaching and reattaching the Mac to the Studio Display didn’t help. Neither did restarting the MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n<p>I had one last guess for a fix: restarting the Studio Display. But there are no buttons on the display, and there are no software controls in Mac OS to tell an attached Studio Display to restart.<sup id=\"fnr1-2022-04-13\"><a href=\"#fn1-2022-04-13\">1</a></sup> So, under my desk I crawled. Pulled the power plug from the wall socket, waited a few seconds, plugged it back in. To my knowledge, this is the first time my Studio Display review unit restarted since I first plugged it in on March 11. (My unit came with “firmware” version 15.4 (build 19E241), which is still the current version, so I’ve yet to see the firmware update process firsthand.<sup id=\"fnr2-2022-04-13\"><a href=\"#fn2-2022-04-13\">2</a></sup>)</p>\n\n<p>The Studio Display rebooted. While booting, it shows a black background with three small circles aligned horizontally, and those dots animate side-to-side. Seems like this would be better if the animation were Apple’s standard clock-like circular spinner, but whatever, the Studio Display doesn’t take long to boot.</p>\n\n<p>Plugged the MacBook Pro back in and boom — audio was back to normal. Problem solved.</p>\n\n<p>But “pull the power cord out of the wall” is not exactly an intuitive solution to glitchy audio. It is fascinating that the Studio Display is, under the hood, a self-contained iOS computer, but the overwhelming majority of Studio Display owners will never know that, nor should they. A monitor is the sort of thing you expect to plug in and never need to unplug — certainly not just to get sound working.</p>\n\n<p>All sorts of devices are really computers under the hood today. My refrigerator has an embedded computer of some sort, for controlling temperatures, ice-making, and notifying me when filters are due to be changed. I’ve owned it for over five years and have never needed to reboot it. I expect a <em>display</em> from the world’s most-renowned computer company to be at least as reliable a computer as my refrigerator.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re going to design a display without a power button, it ought never need to be power-cycled.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2022-04-13\">\n<p>Or at least no such commands I’m aware of. If there’s a command-line incantation or something that can do this, I’d love to hear about it.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2022-04-13\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2022-04-13\">\n<p>Speaking of Studio Display firmware updates, we’ve seen nada on that front in terms of addressing the deplorable image quality of the built-in camera. I’ve heard nothing on that front, officially or unofficially, since I posted <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/17/three-updates-regarding-studio-display\">this on March 17</a>. I’ve heard from some early Studio Display buyers who were hoping for a software fix for the camera image quality before their return windows expired. Perhaps Murphy’s Law will kick in and a “<em>hey, the camera quality is now at least as good as an iPad</em>” update will drop this week — but I’m resigned to accepting that the Studio Display just has a crappy camera.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr2-2022-04-13\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

Still, the paltry audience casts doubt on the future of the application following the recently completed combination of Discovery and WarnerMedia into Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s an interesting idea. People <em>do</em> pay monthly subscription fees to watch exclusive entertainment and sports content on streaming services. Might not they pay for streaming news, too? Perhaps not. 10,000 users per day is crickets-chirping territory for CNN.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/12/cnn-plus-low-viewership-numbers-warner-bros-discovery.html\">cnbc.com/2022/04/12/cnn-plus-low-viewership-numbers-warner…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

The Buccaneers moved ahead with Bruce Arians as head coach and assessed their options at quarterback.</p>\n\n<p>By March 30, Brady was back with the Bucs, preparing to play his 23rd NFL season at age 45. And his head coach was Todd Bowles after Arians retired and took a consulting job with the team.</p>\n\n<p>How did this drastic turn of events take place in just two months? This wasn’t a Brett Favre situation, with Brady walking away for several months before getting the itch again during training camp. Brady was “retired” for all of 40 days, and came back in time for the Buccaneers to be active in free agency.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, Brady’s change of heart was the result of a fascinating fall of dominos involving the Miami Dolphins, Sean Payton, Brian Flores’s lawsuit, former Patriots offensive lineman Rich Ohrnberger, and a Manchester United soccer match.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This story is kind of bananas on the surface, but makes sense. The real fly in the ointment of the whole scheme was Brian Flores’s discrimination lawsuit against the Dolphins and the NFL.

Duh, right? We all know that. But it’s really kind of silly when you consider that even Twitter’s own CEO, sharing important breaking news, has to use screenshots to share even a “brief note”. (The seemingly obvious solution would be to allow users to include a text attachment to a tweet, the same way we’ve been able to attach images and videos for years.)</p>\n\n<p>From the note:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We announced on Tuesday that Elon would be appointed to the Board\ncontingent on a background check and formal acceptance. Elon’s\nappointment to the board was to become officially effective 4/9,\nbut Elon shared that same morning that he will no longer be\njoining the board.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is the “background check” relevant here? Like, did something turn up in the background check that Twitter deemed problematic? The simple explanation is that Musk simply realized that he could have freer rein — and thus more fun, and more influence — <em>not</em> on the board than on it. But why mention the background check at all here then? Just as a jab — a not-so-subtle dig?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I believe this is for the best. We have and will always value\ninput from our shareholders whether they are on our Board or\nnot. Elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to\nhis input.</p>\n\n<p>There will be distractions ahead, but our goals and priorities\nremain unchanged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Translation: <em>We are largely beholden to Elon Musk now, as our stock price is inextricably tied to his continuing shareholding.</em></p>\n\n<p>I mean what happens to Twitter’s share price if Musk dumps all his stock and tweets something like “I tried to help Twitter but the company is run by a bunch of bozos. I’m out.” That’s just 76 characters and I bet it would tank Twitter’s stock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1513354622466867201\">twitter.com/paraga/status/1513354622466867201</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Moreover, the post-ATT world is freeing up more money for the sort of top-of-funnel advertising that would probably be the norm on a Netflix advertising service. In short, the opportunity is there, the product is right, and the business need is pressing in a way it wasn’t previously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thompson and I talked about this on <a href=\"https://dithering.fm/\">Dithering</a> last week, and I think this is a fascinating question. The first thing to note is that the “Netflix should sell ads” take that Thompson espouses is about adding new lower-priced tiers that are subsidized through commercials — <em>no one</em> is arguing that Netflix should add ads to existing subscription tiers. Basically, what’s being suggested is the Hulu model: pay something to get access but with ads, or pay more to get access without any ads at all.</p>\n\n<p>When you keep that point in mind, as a business case, it makes a lot of sense for Netflix to expand this way. My argument against Netflix doing this is about <em>brand</em>, though. Netflix has built an incredibly valuable brand, and part of that brand’s foundation is that Netflix is a premium service that doesn’t do rinky-dink shit like force you to watch unskippable ads. When you’re a Netflix customer, Netflix is always on your side. Unskippable ads are not on your side. Ergo Netflix should never create a lower-priced-with-ads subscription tier. Yes, they’d add more subscribers that way, and goose revenue growth for a few more years, but I think the revenue they’d gain would be outweighed, significantly, by the brand equity they’d lose in doing so. Netflix isn’t just like Hulu or Peacock or any of the also-ran services with ads. Netflix is fucking Netflix, <em>the</em> leading streaming service.</p>\n\n<p>There’s no way to account for brand value on a balance sheet, but great CEOs know what it’s worth in their guts, and savvy investors should too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"x-netnewswire-hide\" style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2022/why-netflix-should-sell-ads/\">stratechery.com/2022/why-netflix-should-sell-ads/</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Each game broadcast will employ\nstate-of-the-art cameras, including high-speed Phantoms, the\nhigh-resolution Megalodon, and more throughout the season to\npresent vivid, live-action shots, and offer immersive sound in 5.1\nwith spatial audio enabled. “Friday Night Baseball” will also\nincorporate new on-screen graphics that include innovative new\nprobabilities-based forecasts of different situational outcomes,\nplus highlights and live look-ins from around the league\nintegrated right into the broadcast.

The lack of pause and fast-forwarding is a technical issue that’s entirely in Apple’s hands, I think. (I don’t think they support those features in live-streamed event keynotes, either.) The lack of 4K (and HDR) might be more of a league-wide infrastructure issue — I’m not sure if <em>any</em> regular season MLB games are broadcast on TV or streamed in 4K.</p>\n\n<p>Excited to see how this goes, and how Apple can improve the technology of “Friday Night Baseball” as the season proceeds.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

			"content_html": "\n<p>Apple last week adjusted its proposed plan for compliance with the Netherlands ACM’s regulations on dating apps. <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=jmps5hyj\">Three changes were announced</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n<li><p>Removal of the Separate Binary Requirement: Apple is eliminating\nthe requirement that developers of dating apps in the\nNetherlands who choose to use the above entitlements must create\nand use a separate binary. This change means that developers may\ninclude either entitlement in their existing dating app, but\nstill must limit its use to the app in the Netherlands\nstorefront and on devices running iOS or iPadOS.</p></li>\n<li><p>Payment Service Provider Criteria: Apple is providing updated\nand more-specific criteria to evaluate non-Apple payment\nservice providers that developers of dating apps in the\nNetherlands may use.</p></li>\n<li><p>Consumer Disclosures: Apps that use either entitlement need to\ninclude an in-app modal sheet that explains to users that\nthey’re going to make purchases through an external payment\nsystem, and the potential impact that choice could have on the\nuser. Apple is adjusting the language on the modal sheet and\nreducing the number of times the sheet must be displayed.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>None of these proposed changes are earth-shattering, but they’re all for the better.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s initial proposal that apps using these entitlements in the Netherlands would need to do so using a separate binary — meaning, a second Netherlands-only version of the app — seemed deliberately confusing. One problem with requiring a separate binary, for example, is that Dutch users who already have one or more dating apps installed might not have gotten updated versions that use these new entitlements via software update. There are some popular apps in the App Store with multiple binaries, but it’s unusual. Sometimes it’s a split between a free/lite version and a paid/pro version, but that’s less common these days, where the typical strategy is a free-to-download-and-use version that contains an in-app purchase to unlock additional features or remove ads.</p>\n\n<p>The other notable change is to the required language in the warning screen users must be presented before making purchases via non-Apple payment processors or being sent to the web. Here’s the <em>previous</em> version of the warning screen (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch\">which I wrote about two months ago</a>): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><b>Title:</b> This app does not support the App Store’s private and\nsecure payment system</p>\n\n<p><b>Body:</b> All purchases in the &lt;App Name&gt; app will be managed by\nthe developer “﹤Developer Name﹥.” Your stored App Store payment\nmethod and related features, such as subscription management and\nrefund requests, will not be available. Only purchases through the\nApp Store are secured by Apple.</p>\n\n<p>Learn More</p>\n\n<p>Action 1: Continue <br />\nAction 2: Cancel</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here’s the updated version, from Apple’s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement/\">developer page for the StoreKit External Purchase Entitlement</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><b>Title:</b> This app doesn’t support the App Store’s payment system.</p>\n\n<p><b>Body:</b> All purchases in this app will be managed by the developer\n“&lt;Developer Name&gt;.” You will no longer be transacting with\nApple. Your stored App Store payment method and related features,\nsuch as subscription management and refund requests, will not be\navailable. Apple is not responsible for the privacy or security of\ntransactions made with this developer.</p>\n\n<p>Learn More</p>\n\n<p>Action 1: Continue <br />\nAction 2: Cancel</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The changes to this language are subtle, but good. “This app doesn’t support the App Store’s payment system” is simply true. As I wrote in February, the old title sort of implied not just that Apple’s payment system is private and secure, but that <em>only</em> Apple’s payment system is private and secure. The new language is more matter-of-fact, which feels appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, though, Apple still hasn’t said what’s supposed to happen if a user taps on “Learn More”.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=grjqafts\">Apple also last week announced an update</a> on “reader” app distribution, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/01/apple-anti-steering-relaxation\">pursuant to their agreement last September with the Japan Fair Trade Commission</a>. Apple:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Last year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/\">announced</a> an update coming to the App Store\nin early 2022 that would allow developers of “reader” apps to\ninclude an in-app link to their website for account creation and\nmanagement purposes. Starting today, with the update of <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps\">App Store\nReview guideline 3.1.3(a)</a>, developers of reader apps can now\nrequest access to the External Link Account Entitlement. This\nentitlement lets reader apps link to a website that is owned or\nmaintained by the developer, so that users can create or manage\ntheir account outside of the app. Reader apps are apps that\nprovide one or more of the following digital content types — magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, or video — as the\nprimary functionality of the app.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/reader-apps/\">Learn about the External Link Account Entitlement</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Baby steps, but all of these changes are in the direction of decreasing regulatory pressure. Apple can be stubborn but they’re not stupid.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

Johnson, who directed the low-budget film “White Elephant,” first worked with Willis decades ago when he was a stuntman. But when the filmmaker and the actor met briefly before shooting began in Georgia last April, “it was clear that he was not the Bruce I remembered,” Johnson said. Concerned about Willis’ mental state, he said he approached the actor’s team — which is led by his assistant-turned-handler Stephen J. Eads — and bluntly asked about the actor’s condition.</p>\n\n<p>“They stated that he was happy to be there, but that it would be best if we could finish shooting him by lunch and let him go early,” Johnson recalled of the conversation. Filmmakers proceeded to quickly film the actor’s parts, even as Willis questioned where he was: “I know why you’re here, and I know why you’re here, but why am I here?” two crew members said he asked aloud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sad story, but it explains Willis’s seemingly-odd low-budget film choices in recent years.

Often, knowing the game, the in-house\ncounsel included in these Communicate-with-Care emails does not\nrespond at all,” the DOJ told the court. The fact that attorneys\noften don’t reply to the emails “underscor[es] that these\ncommunications are not genuine requests for legal advice but\nrather an effort to hide potential evidence,” the DOJ said. [...]</p>\n\n<p>CCing lawyers is a <a href=\"https://www.todaysgeneralcounsel.com/to-cc-or-not-to-cc-that-is-the-privilege-question/\">common\npractice</a>,\nbut the DOJ says Google took it to an “egregious” level. “Google’s\ninstitutionalized manufacturing of false privilege claims is\negregious, spanning nearly a decade and permeating the company\nfrom the top executives on down,” the DOJ said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Without commenting on Google’s program or the specifics of the DOJ’s accusations, the broader issue makes me think about the nature of digital communication. Pre-email, business communication between colleagues was typically either in-person (not recorded), on the phone (not recorded), or via printed memoranda and reports (recorded, on paper). During a legal inquiry, printed memos could be subpoenaed or subject to discovery, and phone records could too. But telephone records only show who called whom, when, and for how long. The content of phone calls wasn’t (and still isn’t) recorded.</p>\n\n<p>Email corresponds directly to the form of printed memos. That’s even where email lingo like “CC” and the “Subject” line comes from. (“CC” originally stood for “<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carbon%20copy\">carbon copy</a>”, which is how those copies were actually made — using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_paper\">carbon paper</a>.) Emails are seemingly just like paper memos, only digital. But, because email is so much more profoundly convenient to use, both to send and receive, it quickly became more casual. Psychologically, using email for work <em>feels</em> a lot more like face-to-face conversations or phone calls. Many people with office jobs send thousands of emails per year at work. Only a maniac sent out thousands of printed memos per year pre-email.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t think you have to be doing something immoral or on shaky legal footing to want to communicate with colleagues privately, without fear of those communications being exposed in future legal inquiries. Any sort of strategic deliberation is something you’d naturally want to remain forever private. So I get the basic desire. But I think a loose policy of just cc’ing company attorneys on we-want-this-to-remain-private emails is a poor strategy. The emails are still there. And the DOJ and state attorneys general can look at this behavior, see that the lawyers aren’t really involved in the discussions, and raise a stink about it, as they have with Google. Whatever the contents of those emails, this “Communicate With Care” program <em>looks</em> shady.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, writing about a Phil Schiller email that was made public through discovery in the Epic v. Apple lawsuit, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut#fn1-2021-06-07\">I asked a question in a footnote</a>:<sup id=\"fnr1-2022-03-24\"><a href=\"#fn1-2022-03-24\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It really has all been email, too. Unless I’m missing something,\nnot one piece of communication entered into evidence — from\neither Apple or Epic — has been anything other than an email\nmessage. Not one message from iMessage or any other messaging\nservice. I find that very surprising. Do Apple executives never\nuse iMessage to discuss work? Nor Epic’s? If anyone with legal\nexpertise can explain why this is, let me know.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I got a few answers from readers. Basically, there’s little that would stop either side in a lawsuit from demanding access to private messages from services like iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, <s>Telegram,</s> etc. [Correction: <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/25/telegram-encryption\">Telegram should not be in that list</a>.] In criminal investigations, of course, law enforcement often does attempt to obtain such messages — law enforcement tries to obtain <em>everything</em>. But in many civil proceedings there’s an unspoken gentleperson’s agreement not to pursue such messages through discovery, being deemed too broad, too personal, too invasive. Technically, there’s a big difference between these services and email. Email is stored unencrypted on a server. The aforementioned messaging services are end-to-end encrypted. You’d have to get them from the individual parties’ devices — presuming they weren’t deleted.</p>\n\n<p>So what I don’t get about Google’s “Communicate With Care” policy is why it involves email at all. Why not a policy recommending against using email, period, for anything deemed confidential? I get that Google is in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/\">a uniquely awkward position</a> regarding post-email messaging services, but how about just using a service other than email that’s end-to-end encrypted? Or discussing all such matters in person or over voice? Part of me thinks this “Communicate With Care” policy at Google is just arrogant, but more than that, I think it’s just foolishly stubborn. If you don’t want it discovered, don’t put it in email.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/12/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-dismisses-privacy\">as Eric Schmidt himself once advised</a>, “If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.”</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2022-03-24\">\n<p>Speaking of footnotes, post-publication, a friend pointed me to at least one iMessage exchange that <em>was</em> entered into evidence in Epic v. Apple — exhibit PX-0276, between Apple employees Herve Sibert and Eric Friedman. I can’t find a link online, but it was part of a trove of evidence that was briefly hosted on Box.com during the trial. I’ll host <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/PX-0276.pdf\">a copy of the PDF here</a>. It doesn’t strike me as particularly interesting in and of itself, but it does show that at least one iMessage exchange was entered into evidence.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2022-03-24\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "
