# Feed Enhancements

Usually pair well with analysis

Since Analysis can compure interesting stuff, the enhancements are often in
charge of wrapping those with meaningful and well managed side effects.

They might place the analysis in the body within a footer they might add it to
the feed as meta data for another application to pick up.

enhancements need to define default values for all params but more important
define the params and how they are marshalled from the proxy URL

analysis may have params required

- so those must be plugged via defaults as much as reasonable

With ALL Params VALID:

- returns transformed feed

With all Params Not Valid returns"

- a form where all params are shown and are fillable
- an ID for compact usage {{where this ID keeps all the params except URL}}

## Enhancement Interface

#### Run function

-

> Provider Functions

- `[providerName]:{install, remove}`
- aws: {install, remove}
- gcloud: {install, remove}
- azure: {install, remove}

> Params

- run: JSON Schema
- cloud:
  - install: JSON Schema
  - remove: JSON Schema
  - aws: JSON Schema
  - gcloud: JSON Schema
